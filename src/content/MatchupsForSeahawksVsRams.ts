**1. RB Kenneth Walker and Offensive Line vs Rams Front 7**

The Seahawks run game has performed poorly in the last 4 games of the season, only going above 50 yards once against the Cardinals in that stretch. This will be their best opportunity to get it going again against a front 7 who doesn't have Aaron Donald, one of the best (if not the best) defensive tackle in the league. The Rams still have other players that are good at stopping the run, such as Bobby Wagner or Leonard Floyd, making it still difficult for the Seahawks struggling run game to get going. If the Seahawks wish to get consistency on offense, they will need to reestablish the run game that they have been lacking.

**2. WR DK Metcalf vs CB Jalen Ramsey**

DK Metcalf vs Jalen Ramsey has been a big matchup in the Seahawks-Rams rivalry ever since Metcalf joined the league, with up and down results for both players. Last year, Metcalf was able to beat Ramsey multiple times in the first Rams game, leading to over 50 yards and a touchdown given up with Ramsey in coverage. Ramsey played better though in the second game, limiting Metcalf to under 50 yards while in coverage and no touchdowns, although Metcalf did get open on several deep routes but couldn't connect with QB Russell Wilson. So far this year, Ramsey had a rough year by his standards, allowing over 400 yards and 4 touchdowns for 100+ passer rating. It will be interesting to see how QB Geno Smith and Metcalf can take advantage of this or instead look to other options for offensive output.

**3. Seahawks Pass Rush vs Rams Offensive Line**

The Seahawks defensive pass rush has been extremely inconsistent this season, playing well against the Giants and Chargers, but then falling off a cliff against the Raiders and Buccaneers, allowing the opposing QB to have all day to pick apart the defense. The Seahawks specifically need more from the interior pass rush rotation, which has yielded little for them in the past few weeks. The Seahawks will need more from them in order to consistently stop the Rams offense.

**4. Seahawks Secondary vs Rams WR Core**

The Seahawks secondary will have much easier competition than they have had for the past few games, going against Davante Adams, Mike Evans, and Deandre hopkins. With Cooper Kupp and Allen Robinson out, the secondary will have to defend against WRs Van Jefferson, Ben Skowronek, and Lance McCutcheon, making it easier for the Seahawks to defend against them and QB John Wolford. Expect the secondary to win their matchup today, convincingly
