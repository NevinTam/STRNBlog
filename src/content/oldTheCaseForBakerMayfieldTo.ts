    Baker Mayfield is a polarizing figure within the NFL today. At times he has shown he can play well and at other times he looks like the worst starter within the league. After the Browns traded for Deshaun Watson, trade talks for Mayfield seemed imminent, and with the Seahawks as one of the last teams left with question marks at quarterback, what would be the benefits and drawbacks of signing the former Browns QB.

**High Draft Pedigree**

Mayfield had an extremely hot start when transitioning into the NFL. Mayfield won the 2017 Heisman by a large majority and then went on to have a great rookie season as the No 1. overall pick by the Browns. He threw for over 3700 yards and 28 touchdowns in his rookie year, breaking rookie records and being in the OROY discussion for much of the season. This stretch of high-level play in both levels of national football indicates that Baker has talent that the Seahawks can use.

**Best QB on Seattle's Roster**

If the Seahawks were to acquire Baker in any way he would be the best QB on Seattle's roster. While Geno Smith and Drew Lock have had almost no success in the NFL, Mayfield has been able to improve over the last few seasons except last year due to his injury. Baker has had a 30--30 record as a starter with a continuous rebuilding Browns team that has not had the best receiving options in recent years. With 3 different Head Coaches in Cleveland and limited weapons, Baker has been unable to hold his ground due to the constant change around him. Adding him into a more stable environment would make him almost a near-immediate QB1 on the Seattle roster.

**Cons**

**Extremely Inconsistent Passer**

While Baker has had his fair share of highs, with that comes his fair share of lows. Coming off a good rookie season in 2018, he regressed quite a bit in his sophomore season, throwing over 20 interceptions and less touchdowns in a season where the Browns seemed poised to start competing. Then in 2020, Mayfield heated up again, playing extremely well at the end of the season that got them ever-so-close to beating the Chiefs in the divisional round. Then following that, he had his worst season yet in a disaster 2021 campaign. he missed time with injuries, and at times looked unplayable and the direct reason why his team was losing games. If the Seahawks wish to trade for him, they could attempt to fix his inconsistencies or simply keep him as a bridge QB, which has its own issues...

**Massive 5th Year Option Price**

While we have talked about the positives and negatives of Baker, we haven't talked about acquiring him as he isn't currently on the team. If the Seahawks were to trade for him they would need to negotiate Baker's massive 5th-year option price with the Browns as Mayfield is being paid $18.85 million, a price much too hefty. A way for the Seahawks to still get Baker would be if the Browns were to cut him Seattle could sign him as a free agent, but the Browns don't seem to want to cut the former Heisman winner. Also, Baker has not played up to his fully guaranteed near $20 million contract, and for someone who could lose the job to Geno Smith or Drew Lock, paying that price for a backup would not be worth it. If the Seahawks want Baker a standout negative is not so much with the player, but the extremely large price that comes with him.

While there are definitely some reasons why the Seahawks should stray away from Baker Mayfield, there is a lot to why we SHOULD get him. From his cannon of an arm to being a former first overall pick who was a Heisman winner, Baker definitely has some potential left inside. Likewise, he has not lived up to his draft pedigree but like Geno Smith and Drew Lock, the other quarterbacks on Seattle's roster, they have not met expectations as former first and second-round drafted quarterbacks.
