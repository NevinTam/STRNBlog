**Offense**

Looking at the basic box stats, you see the Seahawks only put up 20 points against one of the worst defenses in the league. And while the Seahawks did struggle heavily on offense in scoring, they were the best they had been all season on 3rd down. For the first time this season, they converted more than half of their 3rd downs, converting 7 times on 13 3rd downs. Geno Smith threw a bad INT in the redzone again, an area that needs to be addressed quickly before big mistakes like that cost them the game. Otherwise from the INT, Geno Smith had a sound game with 219 yards and a 75% completion percentage for 2 touchdowns.

Kenneth Walker was the highlight of the game, recording a 4.0 average yards per carry after posting a sub-4 ypc last game. He also eclipsed 100 rushing yards, the only running back across the entire league to do so. RB Zach Charbonnet was inactive with an injury against the Cardinals, allowing Walker to get every RB rushing carry for the Seahawks for the entire game.   

The Seahawks were without star WR DK Metcalf who missed his first game of his career against the Cardinals. This meant young WRs Jake Bobo and Jaxon Smith-Njigba needed to emerge as quality receivers, and they did just that. JSN and Bobo led the team in receiving yards, even more than Lockett who was most likely double-teamed the entire game with standout WR DK Metcalf out. Jake Bobo had 4 receptions for 61 yards and JSN 4 receptions for 63 yards. Each rookie WR had a TD on the game. Seattle's tight ends were relatively limited, as the entire TE group combined for 3 receptions and 51 yards. DeeJay Dallas was limited on offense, even as the RB2 with Zach Charbonnet out, only recording a reception for 0 yards without a single rushing attempt.

**Defense**

The defense had another phenomenal game against the Cardinals, limiting the Cardinals to sub 250 yards of offense. While the rushing defense showed some cracks against the misdirection-runs that the Cardinals threw at them, they were able to stop them when it mattered. The Seahawks held the Cardinals to just a 33% conversion rate on third down, which was the 3rd straight opponent the Seahawks held under 40 percent. The Seahawks also shut the Cardinals out in the second half while recording 4 sacks to close the game out.

Individually, the Seahawks had many standout performers. In the secondary, Devon Witherspoon had a great game in coverage and tackling, almost recording a pick and a sack that were taken off due to penalties on other players. Woolen had a good game in coverage, but suffered in tackling and committed one of the penalties that took away a sack from Witherspoon. On a Josh Dobbs QB run, Woolen barely laid a finger on him as he scored from 25-yards out. Diggs, Adams, and Love all played good games by taking away deep routes from WRs like Marquise Brown and limiting check-downs in the flats.

The linebackers played exceptionally today. They were great in run defense except for a few plays, and were able to limit check downs to a few yards. LB Jordyn Brooks especially had an incredible game in the second half. He was everywhere, putting pressure on Dobbs and being instrumental in the run game. The pass rush also played well this game. They weren't able to get most of their sacks until the end of the game, but they were able to put consistent pressure on Dobbs to force errant throws. This pressure will be key next week as they will be without pass rusher Uchenna Nwosu for the rest of the season with a pectoral injury.
