**The Present and the Past**   
The Seahawks started the first 5 games of the season allowing opponents to accumulate 430 yards per game. During those weeks they allowed opponents to get 24+ first downs each game. Since those atrocious weeks, the Seahawks have allowed less than 290 yards and 17 first downs per game. What changed over the practices from week 5 to 6, and what has recent history shown us about a Pete Carroll run defense?

During 2021, the Seahawks' defense faced a similar rollercoaster, in terms of yards and first downs allowed compared to the first and second halves of the year. From weeks 1 through 5 the yards and first downs allowed were 450 yards and 26 first downs, even worse than the early 2022 Seahawks' defense. Over the remainder of the 2021 season, the yards allowed decreased to under 350 yards, or approximately 100 yards less than the first half, and the first downs allowed per game went to 22, or 4 fewer fresh sets of downs each game.   

During 2020, the Seahawks' defense also had an even worse first half, giving up on average 479 yards and 28 first downs from weeks 1 through 7. With the biggest turnaround of all 3 years, the average yards allowed went to 321, an improvement of more than 150 yards, while the first downs had their biggest decrease of all 3 years, dropping to 21.   

If we summarize the turnarounds we can see history has repeated itself over and over, and the present is much better than the past.  

2022 Weeks 1-5 - 430 YA - 24 FD, Weeks 6 - 8 - 290 YA - 17 FD  
2021 Weeks 1-5 - 450 YA - 26 FD, Weeks 6 - 18 - 350 YA - 22 FD  
2020 Weeks 1-7 - 479 YA - 28 FD, Weeks 8 - 17 - 321 YA - 21 FD  

Judging from the struggles from the earlier parts of this year, and the recent history of our defense being able to turn around after a few weeks, a change was seeable. While it is still early, let's just hope that the team can maintain its excellency from these last three weeks for the remainder of the season.   

**The Causes of the Turnaround**   

Statistically, we can see the rush yards allowed per game dramatically dropped from weeks 1-5 to 6-8. More specifically, the rush yards allowed since the end of the Saints' game have been 92 on average. Before the Cardinals game, the average was 170 yards per game. As evidenced, the run defense clearly improved but the entire defense, not just the front-7, deserves credit for the improvement. The Seahawks heavily improved on tackling the ball carrier, not just going for the fumble, but missing and allowing the carrier to continue to run.

The majority of the credit goes to the front-7, who developed enough chemistry to play cohesively as a unit and fulfill their individual responsibility. Jordyn Brooks improved greatly, cleaning up his tackles which allowed on average, fewer yards per carry. Cody Barton perhaps had the greatest development as he became much improved at finding the right gap to plug, being able to beat his blocker to make the tackle, and overall awareness of the game, more specifically the run plays.   

Another aspect was the EDGE's learning the rules of edge setting. After starting Darrell Taylor for the first few weeks, knowing his incapabilities in setting the edge, the Seahawks started Boye Mafe on run downs, and Taylor exclusively on run downs, and the rush yards allowed immediately decreased. Meanwhile, Uchenna Nwosu was good at run defending, but during the Chargers and Giants' games, the rush yards allowed dramatically decreased, most likely because Bruce Irvin and his veteran experience brought help to the once-deflated run defense. In the 2 weeks with Irvin, the Seahawks allowed 131 yards, for a combined 65.5 yards per game. That was remarkably impressive knowing they were going against two of the league's best running backs, in terms of Austin Ekeler and Saquon Barkley, respectively.

The final factor in the progressed run game was the defensive ends and tackles. As Pete Caroll specifically spoke, in the prior weeks with the weak run defense, the defensive line was asked to read-and-react based on what they saw each individual play, but after numerous weeks of the defense getting bashed, Carroll and the rest of the defensive coaching staff decided to adjust the scheme to fit their personnel, allowing the lineman to play more aggressively without reacting based off their initial quick reads. Once, the changes were made, the defensive line was seeing consistently plugging up holes or beating their blockers, effectively improving the defense's overall play. From the earlier weeks, the Seahawks' opponents' run game was able to achieve slightly over 5 yards per carry, on average, but since the Saint's game, it fell to under 3.9 ypc. If you take out quarterbacks from the run game, and strictly only running backs, who are the only people other than quarterbacks who have had a rushing attempt against the Seahawks in the last 3 games, the average yards per carry allowed goes to just over 2.4, an NFL low over that duration.

The Seahawks have been an interesting team over the course of the last 3 years, to say the least. The offense refuses to function well at the same time as the defense and vice versa, but this year seems to be a miracle as both the offense and defense have performed well for consecutive weeks. Let's just hope the defense continues to play well down the stretch, and the one bad half, one good half, and the pattern doesn't continue in the 2023-2024 season.
