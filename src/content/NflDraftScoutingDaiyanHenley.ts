**Washington State Cougar Daiyan Henley's Scouting Report**

Every year the Senior Bowl provides unheralded prospects with a chance to earn a bag by raising their draft stock with a good performance in Mobile. It also provides us, scouts, a chance to get a look at some of these guys against the best competition from around the nation. This year was no different. Guys like Tank Dell, Michael Wilson, Darius Rush, and Cody Mauch were able to skyrocket their draft stock with their play during the Senior Bowl practice and game. However, if you were watching the game, you would see one defender standing out. He's not than Washington State's own Daiyan Henley.

Henley was initially recruited to Nevada as a wide receiver. After spending a few seasons there and eventually transitioning to linebacker, he chose to spend his redshirt senior season at Washington State. At Wazzu, Henley had an outstanding season as one of the best linebackers in the PAC-12, earning a senior bowl invite in the process. Now for his fit on the Seahawks.

The Jordyn Brooks injury situation is still a little murky, and we are too far out to know whether or not he is able to suit up for week 1 of the season. If he isn't, I think Henley is perfectly capable of playing his "Will" esque linebacker role (given we line up in a 3-4 under front on many occasions, I will refer to the ILB roles as Mike and Will). If Pete Carroll elects to use Henley as a Barton replacement, I would think that we would want him to put on more muscle weight (he's currently sitting near 230) just to make his frame ready to take on Cody's Mike Linebacker role.

I think my evaluation of Daiyan Henley coincides with what NFL scouts will have. With good testing, I think we could see him go in the late 2nd, which would work well for the Seahawks. If he gets into the later parts of day 2, there is a possibility that we snatch his with our 3rd round pick. Overall I would say that I really liked Henley as a player, and I believe that he can be successful wherever he goes in the league. Below is my full evaluation:

Strengths:

* Henley has the lateral agility to win in space, whether it be in the run game, pass coverage, or as a blitzer.

* His explosiveness and bend make him dangerous as a blitzer. He can also convert speed to power to beat RBs.  

  Shortcomings:

* A bit undersized. He shows good physicality to make up for it, but he will have to improve his play strength in the NFL

* Needs to have better body control when working downhill, as fakes sometimes take him out of the play.

Summary:

Daiyan Henley is probably one of my favorite linebackers in this draft. Henley brings the range and athleticism of a modern-day linebacker. He has the ability to cover guys out in space while also bringing the speed necessary to contain opposing QBs. Henley is also a very instinctual player, but sometimes his instincts can lead him to bite too hard on a play. Another downside would be his size, but Henley can negate this somewhat by improving his play strength. I would use Henley as WILL LB in a 4-3, but 3-4 teams can also pair him up with someone bigger and more oriented to stuffing the run. I would feel pretty good about taking him on Day 2.

**Numerical Grade: 77/100**

**Projection: Floor - Serviceable Starter -----\> Ceiling - High-end Starter**

**Round Grade: Mid Day 2**
