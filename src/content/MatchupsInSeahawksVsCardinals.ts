The Cardinals (2-3) play the Seahawks (2-3) in Seattle at 1:05 PST. Both teams are attempting to get back to .500 on the season, as a 2-4 start to a season is a sign that it's time to start thinking about the future rather than this season, as it becomes increasingly difficult to make the playoffs at that point. Here are 5 matchups for this critical matchup between the Seahawks and Cardinals.

**1. Cardinals WRs Marquise Brown, Rondale Moore, and AJ Green vs Seahawks CBs Tariq Woolen, Coby Bryant, and Michael Jackson**

The Seahawks are going against a much more diverse receiving corps than last week against the Saints. Brown, recently acquired in a trade from the Ravens, has a blazing 4.32 second 40-yard dash speed, making it logical for Woolen, the fastest of the CB group, to primarily cover him to limit coverage busts. Green, a storied veteran within the league, is a more physically imposing receiver than Moore and Brown. Even past his prime, his 6 foot 4, 200 pound frame can strike fear into DBs. He will likely be covered by Michael Jackson, who is having a good start to the season while allowing a 55% completion percentage for only 110 yards and a touchdown through 5 games. This ultimately leaves Moore to be covered by primarily guarded by Coby Bryant, who has played better in recent weeks and has forced turnovers in back-to-back games. Moore is a gadget-type player that has shifty speed, making it a challenge for Bryant to cover him.

**2. Cardinals QB Kyler Murray and RB Eno Benjamin vs Seahawks Front 7**

The Seahawks front 7 have allowed a plethora of running backs to accumulate yardage on them, but now they must also plan for how to deal with a mobile QB like Kyler Murray. Last week we saw that the defense gave up big play after big play to Taysom Hill who wasn't even really playing QB for most of the game, rather just taking direct snaps and then running. Murray will be a different sort of threat, with his scrambiling ability he could easily pick up first downs to extend drives and extend plays, possibly leading to explosive plays to WR Marquise Brown, which has been seen throughout the season. The Cardinals are injured at the RB position with RB1 James Connor out, leading to RB2 Eno Benjamin to get the starting role for Sunday. With Al Woods doubtful to play for the Seahawks, it will be crucial for them to stop the run.

**3. Cardinals Interior Defensive Line vs Seahawks Interior Offensive Line**

The Seahawks interior offensive line has performed well at times but at other times has led to significant pressure and lack of push in the run game, a reason why the Seahawks have had the most success so far running to the outside on their explosive runs. Worse is that starting RG Gabe Jackson is declared doubtful, making this part of the offensive line even thinner than before. On the other side, the Cardinals employ players like JJ Watt and Zach Allen, who have played a key part in the Cardinals pass rush while also playing well in the run game, limiting ball carriers to 4.3 YPC in 5 games.

**4. Cardinals Front 7 vs Seahawks RB Kenneth Walker**

Speaking of the run defense, it will the first true test for RB Kenneth Walker, who will be seeing his first significant snaps of the season replacing the injured Rashaad Penny. Walker will have to flash some of that speed that he has shown at times. The Cardinals run defense has mostly shut down ball carriers to 4 YPC, meaning Walker will have a big challenge to run efficiently against such a run defense. It will be key to also watch the Seahawks tackles Charles Cross and Abraham Lucas in how they will to seal the edge for Walker to get into space, where he performs the best.

**5. Seahawks WRs DK Metcalf and Tyler Lockett vs Cardinals CBs Byron Murphy and Marco Wilson**

The Seahawks WRs have played exceptional in the post-Russell Wilson era, as Lockett is on pace for career highs in yards and receptions, with DK hovering around the same mark. Look for QB Geno Smith to utilize this WR duo against Murphy and Wilson. Murphy has played well, allowing 150 yards and a completion percentage of 58 percent over 5 games, however, he has given up 2 touchdowns in that span. Marco Wilson has been more of a liability in coverage, giving up 241 yards and a completion percentage of 57% through only 4 games. Expect the early-passing attack that the Seahawks have frequently used throughout the past 5 weeks to continue against the Cardinals.
