The Seahawks are heading into the 2023 offseason fresh off an unexpected playoff berth in a "rebuilding" season. This berth came with ups and downs from various players on both sides of the line of scrimmage, and in this article, we will focus on free agent defenders and at what prices they should be resigned, from players such as Poona Ford to Ryan Neal. Read below for specific information for each player.

**IDL Poona Ford**

Ford has been with the Seahawks ever since being undrafted out of Texas in 2018 and received a 2-year extension following the 2020 season. While Ford has played like a great run defender in his years with the Seahawks, many expected him to improve his pass-rising in 2021 and 2022, which led to him getting more pass-rushing looks as a 3-technique, which did not have positive results. With the additions of Quinton Jefferson and Shelby Harris in the 2022 offseason, Ford received less playing time while the whole run defense severely regressed in 2022, including Ford. While Ford is a good player, the Seahawks might decide to go younger and cheaper on the defensive line.

**Expected Free Agency Offer:**1-year contract worth 4.5 million

Sh**ould the Seahawks resign**: The Seahawks shouldn't resign Ford due to the depth ahead of him on the roster and his lack of fit in the newer 3-4 scheme.

**SS Johnathan Abram**

The Seahawks claimed Abram off waivers from the Packers in the middle of the season after safeties Ryan Neal and Jamal Adams sustained injuries. Abram was a first-round pick for the Las Vegas Raiders in 2019 and saw extensive playing time before being waived in the middle of the season. Abram saw several starts for the Seahawks in favor of the benched Josh Jones and was able to do a good job against the run game. In the passing game, he was somewhat prone to penalties when interfering with other receivers.

**Expected Free Agency Offer**: 1-year contract worth 1.5 million

**Should the Seahawks Resign**: The Seahawks might decide to sign Abram late in free agency as a depth piece or in training camp to the practice squad

**IDL L.J. Collier**

LJ Collier was the Seahawks' first-round pick in the 2019 draft and was hoped to be a force rushing the passer from the interior. However, he failed to impress, falling lower and lower in the depth chart until he became a healthy scratch for many of the Seahawks' games these past two seasons.

**Expected Free-Agency Offer**: 1-year contract worth veteran minimum.

**Should the Seahawks Resign**: No, as the Seahawks could replace Collier with younger talent through the draft or free agency.

**CB Artie Burns**

Artie Burns was a late offseason pickup last year after spending the previous season with the Bears. One reason many thought he came to Seattle was because of the recent hire of associate head coach Sean Desai, who was the defensive coordinator of the Bears while Burns was starting for the last few games of the season. Burns was seen as a possible CB2 alongside Sidney Jones as training camp began, but he fell on the depth chart and was injured for the beginning of the season, leading to him only playing in 3 games the entire season.

**Expected Free-Agency Offer:**1-year contract worth 2 million

**Should the Seahawks Resign:**No, as the Seahawks can find more depth in the later rounds of the draft that will be younger and cheaper than signing Burns.

**CB Justin Coleman**

Justin Coleman signed with the Seahawks in the offseason after having a bit of a bounce-back season at nickel CB for the Miami Dolphins. He was a Seahawk during the 2017-18 seasons and enjoyed great success before signing to a record-breaking deal with the Detroit Lions. He was released only 2 years into his 4 year deal and then signed with Miami. He seemed primed to take over the slot-corner position for the Seahawks, but the Seahawks instead opted to start rookie Coby Bryant at the slot cornerback position. Coleman was active for 12 games during the season but saw very minimal playing time and did not start any games.

**Expected Free-Agency Offer:**1 year contract worth veteran minimum.

**Should the Seahawks Resign:**No, as the Seahawks have found their nickel cornerback in Coby Bryant and instead could draft younger depth at cornerback in the later rounds.

**SS Josh Jones**

Josh Jones was the Packers 2016 second round pick who the Seahawks picked up during training camp. Jones quickly made a big impression on the coaches, as he had lots of opportunities within preseason games and eventually made the roster as a breakout training camp player. Jones quickly became a starter after Jamal Adams suffered a season-ending injury in Week 1, but quickly had issues with defending the run, leading him to be benched in favor of Ryan Neal, who played extremely well for the rest of the season. Jones had a stint on injured reserve before he returned as the primary backup for Neal and played a handful of snaps near the end of the season when Neal was injured.

**Expected Free-Agency Offer:**1 year contract worth veteran minimum

**Should the Seahawks Resign:**No, as the Seahawks could draft a safety in the later rounds and develop them for cheaper than signing Jones.

**SS Jalen "Teez" Tabor**

Jalen Tabor was signed by the Seahawks off the Falcons practice squad early in the season after Jamal Adams suffered a season-ending injury. After a few weeks, Tabor managed to see more and more game time as injuries piled on for the Seahawks strong safeties after Josh Jones was sent to IR and Ryan Neal was ruled out for a couple weeks. Tabor and fellow safety Jonathan Abram filled the void made by these injuries but only played a very limited amount of snaps, as they started 3 games total.

**Expected Free-Agency Offer:**1 year contract worth veteran minimum

**Should the Seahawks Resign:**The Seahawks could resign him to the practice squad later in the offseason for cheap, but most likely they would sign or draft a new safety.

**SS Ryan Neal**

Neal has been with the Seahawks since the beginning of the 2019 season and has steadily improved in every season since then. In 2020, Neal took over for several games when Jamal Adams was injured, playing well in his absence and even recording the game sealing interception of Dak Prescott in Week 4. In the following year, Neal played primarily as the 6th DB, which was used by the Seahawks in certain 3rd down situations. Neal saw more playing time following Jamal Adam's season ending injury, but did not play nearly as well as during the 2020 season. In 2022, Neal took over for Josh Jones, who had a rough start at strong safety after Jamal Adams suffered an season-ending injury in Week 1. Neal played very well throughout the season, making key, momentum-crushing tackles while playing great in coverage until suffering some injuries towards the end of tue year.

**Expected Free-Agency Offer:** 2 year contract worth $10 million

**Should the Seahawks Resign:** Yes, because even with the return of Jamal Adams, the Seahawks could use Neal in other ways to get him onto the field and make plays.

**LB Cody Barton**

Barton was the Seahawks third-round pick in the 2019 draft and was able to start for the first time this season after the Seahawks released Bobby Wagner last offseason. Barton had a very up-and-down 2022 season, as he started the year strong against the Broncos, including disrupting a screen and forcing the Broncos to attempt a 64-yard field goal, which missed. Following that week, however, he was ineffective against the run along with the rest of the Seahawk's defense, leading to a decrease in his playing time. However, as weeks passed, Barton played better and better in coverage, getting 2 interceptions and multiple pass deflections in the last half of the season. However, in the wild-card game against the 49ers, the Seahawks linebackers, including Barton, were exposed as the Niners were able to complete passes in the middle of the field and run the ball with ease all day on-route to a convincing wild-card win.

**Expected Free-Agency Offer:** 1 year contract $4 million

**Should the Seahawks Resign:** No, as the Seahawks can find better linebackers within the draft that could have more potential than Barton. If Barton remains unsigned later in the offseason, it could make sense that the Seahawks resign him as a primary backup but Barton most likely will not be the starter at LB2 for the Seahawks next year.

**LB Tanner Muse**

Tanner Muse was the Raiders 2020 third-round pick and was signed by the Seahawks last season. Muse has primarily played special teams for the Seahawks but after Seahawks LB Jordyn Brooks suffered a season-ending injury, Muse became a starter for 2 games, including the disastrous wild-card game against the 49ers. While Muse may not live up to his third-round selection, he has played well on special teams and can play a few snaps here and there when needed.

**Expected Free-Agency Offer:**1 year contract worth veteran minimum

**Should the Seahawks Resign:**The Seahawks should resign Muse as he has played well on special teams and can be important linebacker depth for the Seahawks thin LB core.

**LB Jon Rhattigan**

Jon Rhattigan was an undrafted LB out of Army who the Seahawks signed before the 2021 season, who primarily played special teams. Near the end of the 2021 season, Rhattigan suffered a torn ACL, which took until December of this season for him to recover from. Rhattigan plays on special teams and has played well, stuffing the stat sheet regularly with special teams tackles.

**Expected Free-Agency Offer:**1 year contract worth veteran minimum

**Should the Seahawks Resign:**The Seahawks should resign Rhattigan because he has an important role for them on special teams.

**OLB Darryl Johnson**

Darryl Johnson was another player who broke out in training camp this past summer and played himself into a roster spot. Johnson received his first start in Week 4 against the Lions after the Seahawks were disappointed by the production of OLB Darrell Taylor. Unfortunately, Johnson suffered a season-ending injury halfway through his first start.

**Expected Free-Agency Offer:**1 year contract worth veteran minimum

**Should the Seahawks Resign:**Yes, as Johnson clearly had enough talent to make the roster, and unfortunately he wasn't able to show that during the season due to injury. It makes sense that the Seahawks would keep him for next year, at least on the practice squad to see if he can replicate what he did in training camp last year.
