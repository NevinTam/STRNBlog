**1. Seahawks RB Ken Walker vs the Buccaneers Front 7**  
Thanks for reading SeahawksToday! Subscribe for free to receive new posts and support my work.  

Currently, after week 9, the Bucs' run defense is 21st in the league, averaging 4.6 yards per carry to opposing ball carriers. Last week against the Rams, the Bucs allowed Darrell Henderson Jr., their starting RB, to get 4.7 yards per carry on 12 carries. Kenneth Walker is coming off an incredibly strong game after posting 109 yards and 2 touchdowns. Devin White, Lavonte David, Vita Vea, and Akiem Hicks will need to turn their run defense around, otherwise expect the Seahawks' run game to be favored and be the central part of their game plan.

**2. Seattle's Interior Offensive Line vs Bucs' Interior Defensive Line**

Probably the weakest part of their offensive line, the interior offensive line has been easily pushed back in pass-blocks, and expect no difference against the Bucs and their recently emerged pass-rushing defensive tackle. Vita Vea has posted 6.5 sacks on the season, projected to post 12 on the season. The Seahawks will face many struggles against Vea, but Hicks is also a player to worry about as he played his first game since week 2 during last week. With the majority of the focus on Vea, his talent may push him into the Seahawks' backfield, but Hicks will also be able to take advantage of the Seahawks' offensive line's game plan being centered around Vea, creating two viable interior lineman Damien Lewis, Austin Blythe, and Gabe Jackson/Phil Haynes need to worry about.

**3. Bucs' Tight Ends vs Seahawks Linebackers**

Cameron Brate is expected to return early morning, after missing every game since week 6. Cade Otton has performed well, posting 64+ yards in 2 of his last 3 games with his first touchdown of the year, which was the last score of the Rams game. After spending time with the Giants, Kyle Rudolph has found his way on the Bucs, but while only posting 2 catches on the season, there are still 3 viable pass-catchers Seahawks linebackers Jordyn Brooks and Cody Barton need to worry about. Last week, TE Zach Ertz was held to a measly 40 yards on 8 targets, for only 5 receptions. Also, Brooks and Barton have largely improved in coverage since the earlier weeks of the year, each only allowing a total of 44 yards on average in coverage each game from the Saints' game onward, versus the first 4 weeks where in total they on average allowed 97 yards in coverage each game. If the LB duo can keep this up expect Bucs' tight ends to be quiet for the majority of the game.

**4. Seahawks' Tight Ends vs Bucs' Linebackers**

Flipping it to the opposite side, we have the Seahawks' three-deep TE room, vs Lavonte David and Devin White. In the last 5 weeks, each tight end has displayed a unique skill set with the group on average posting 76 yards per game. Only considering the last 3 games, the total tight end group's numbers number rise to 81 yards per game. In the last 5 weeks, White and David have allowed on average a total of 31 yards per game. Only considering the last 3 weeks, the average yards allowed in coverage drops to an astounding 24. If either team wants to close out the game with a win, either the LBs or TEs must continue their trends in recent weeks, or else the other team might dominate enough for the win.

**5. Seahawks Cornerbacks vs Bucs' Wide Receivers**

The Buccaneers have an extremely deep wide receiver room, one that consists of Mike Evans, Chris Godwin, Scotty Miller, Julio Jones, and Russell Gage Jr. While, on paper their room looks incredible, mixed with health and production problems, their stats seem lackluster. In the last 3 weeks, Mike Evans has emerged, posting 86 yards on average per game. Chris Godwin, in that same time frame, posted on average 51 yards per game. The rest of the room has combined for 53 yards on average per game in the last 3 weeks. In total, the group has averaged a small 191 yards per game to its top 5 wide receivers. On the flip side, in the last 3 weeks, Seattle's outside corners have allowed an average of 56 yards per game. Throughout the entire season, both corners' average drops to 52 yards per game, an extremely low number for the two young corners. However, for a majority of the game, it will be Evans and Godwin on Woolen and Jackson Sr. respectively, so their 137 receiving yards on average vs Woolen and Jackson's 56 receiving yards allowed on average contrast wildly. Similar to the Seahawks' TEs vs the Bucs' LBs, this might be the turning point in the game for whichever team can break the trend of the other teams' receivers or corners. With an 80+ yard difference from Godwin's and Evan's receiving stats in the last 3 weeks to Tariq's and Michael's, the Seattle corners will need to continue how they have been playing against the star wreceivers if they want to help bring their team to a win against the Buccaneers in the first-ever Germany played NFL game!
