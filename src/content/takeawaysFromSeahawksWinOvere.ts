**Rushing Attack**

The Seahawks rushing game was much better this week against the Jets, as overall they had 190 rushing yards against a top 10 defense. RB Kenneth Walker had his 4th 100 yard rushing game of the year and one of his best performances overall, averaging 5.8 yards per carry. Deejay Dallas complimented Walker as well, coming in as a more of a power back when Walker was resting. Dallas had 6 caries but had 41 yards and an average of 6.1 YPC, as well as having a big YAC reception of 40 yards to bring the Seahawks into the red zone. This was the key reason the Seahawks were able to move the ball consistently into Jets territory and keep an offensive consistency, relieving pressure on QB Geno Smith.

**Defensive Line**

The defensive line played extremely well this game, as they were able to put pressure on Mike White throughout the game. Darrell Taylor had the best game of his career thus far, recording 2.5 sacks along with Quinton Jefferson, who recorded 1.5 sacks. Jefferson has recorded 2.5 sacks in the past 3 weeks along with 7 pressures and 3 tackles for loss, the same he had prior to this 3 game stretch. Taylor has also been quietly producing in the past 5 weeks, recording 5 of his 8.5 sacks in that stretch, breaking his total that he had last season despite being benched for a large chunk of the season due to issues in run defense.

**Linebacker Corps**

The Linebacker group played well last Sunday, with Cody Barton playing one of his best games of the season in coverage and tackling, recording 6 tackles and one TFL while only allowing 16 yards on 4 targets, limiting checkdowns for the Jets offense. Jordyn Brooks suffered a serious ACL injury which knocked him out for the rest of the season, but he had played well in his limited time, forcing a pressure on Jets QB Mike White which turned into a Quandre Diggs interception. Replacing Brooks for the rest of the game was Tanner Muse, who played well for his limited snaps, recording 3 tackles and a pass deflection. The linebackers were also a large part of the improved run defense for the Seahawks, who allowed -1 rushing yards in the second half.

**Improved Secondary Play**

The Secondary also played well on Sunday, limiting Jets QB Mike White to 240 yards, a 50% completion percentage, and a passe rrating of 47.7. He threw 2 picks as well, one to FS Quandre Diggs (his third of the year) and the other to CB Michael Jackson, his first on the season. The Jets constantly had to look in the short to intermediate game in order to move the ball, and when they did they often had to look away from their best WR, Garret Wilson, who is a strong contender for the OROY award. Wilson only had 18 yards on 3 completions, remaining largely ineffective for much of the game. The Seahawks DROY candidate, Tariq Woolen, played a good game on Sunday, allowing 51 yards on 10 targets.



Overall the Seahawks were able to control the game through a staunch defense and and a consistent offense, letting them to run time of the clock to secure a win and keep their playoff hopes alive. In order for them to make it in, they will need to beat the Rams and hope the Lions are able to beat the Packers on SNF.
