**Seahawks Passing Attack vs Titans Pass Defense**

The Titans are going through a war of attrition. They have lost CBs Kristian Fulton and Caleb Farley to IR and have ruled out CB Sean Murphy-Bunting with a knee injury. They have lost both safeties to knee and quad injuries after trading Former All-Pro Kevin Byard to the Eagles. This should be a huge opportunity for the Seahawks' WR core to assert its dominance over a weaker CB core, especially with a healthy Geno Smith at the helm. Look for DK Metcalf to continue one of his most efficient seasons against the Titans. Jaxon Smith-Njigba will likely be lined up against SLCB Elijah Molden, who is coming off a good game against the Texans. Tyler Lockett could bounce back after a quiet game against the Eagles.

Geno Smith will also be back against this weakened Titans defense, who will also be without key contributors on the defensive line, such as elite DT Jeffrey Simmons. This should provide Smith opportunities to pick apart the Titans D with a lacking pass rush.

**Seahawks Rushing Attack vs Titans Rushing Defense**

Even though Kenneth Walker is listed as questionable on the practice report, it looks as if he will be ready to go for this game against the Titans. Walker is coming off a huge game where he was one of the offense's best players, finding excellent cutback lanes and constantly extending runs by managing ways to make guys miss. He will have another opportunity to excel against the struggling Titans defense, which allowed over 100 yards and over 4.5 YPC to Texans RB Devin Singletary.

Furthermore, the Titans will be without key contributors on the defensive line and the linebacker group. This will be another huge opportunity for this offense, who have been plagued with injuries, to show how they can play at their best in the rushing game (with Kenneth Walker and Zach Charbonnet) and the passing game with a healthy Geno Smith.

It would be the biggest Seahawks thing of all time if they failed to score more than 17 and win on a last-second field goal.

**Titans Passing Attack vs Seahawks Passing Defense**

After a great game against the Eagles, limiting Jalen Hurts to under 200 passing yards and 2 INTs, the Seahawks should have another opportunity to extend their streak against a weakened Titans Passing Attack. While the Titans will have Former All-Pro Deandre Hopkins and first-round pick Treylon Burks, they will be without WR3 Kyle Phillips. They will likely also be without QB Will Levis, who is listed as questionable but only practiced in a limited fashion on Friday. If this is the case, the Seahawks will go against QB Ryan Tannehill, who was benched earlier in the season.

The Titans' offensive line, which has undergone several injuries, has not played well this season. WB Will Levis was sacked 7 times last week against a Texans pass rush missing their best player in Will Anderson Jr. The Seahawks should try and repeat such a performance, or at least restart their average pass rush this season. Look for Boye Mafe to have a resurgence after going quiet for the past 5 games.

**Titans Rushing Attack vs Seahawks Rushing Defense**

If you had shown me this matchup a week ago, I would have said this matchup was a case of Movable objects meets stoppable force, as the Seahawks rushing defense had looked like a shell of itself following the season-ending pectoral injury to Uchenna Nwosu. Derrick Henry, the Titans RB, has not looked like himself this season behind this struggling Titans offensive line. Recently against the Texans, Henry failed to eclipse 15 yards from scrimmage on over 15 carries.

After the Eagles game, however, it seemed that the Seahawks were able to stop the Eagles' potent rushing attack (outside of the Tush Push). The Seahawks will likely have to mitigate this rushing attack long enough for their offense to put up several scores, forcing the Titans to attempt a comeback through the air.
