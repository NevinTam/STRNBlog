    1. Special Teams

   I have no complaints about special teams except for one recurring issue. That issue lies within our punting team, led by Micheal Dickson, the perennial punter drafted in the 4th round in the 2018 draft. Dickson himself has not been horrible himself, but the issues against the Saints clearly stemmed from his error. With the Seahawks trying a new punting style against the Saints for the first time, Pete had the utmost confidence in Dickson to execute, but that was mistrusted. After not having confidence in his own abilities, Dickson hesitated in punting the ball, resulting in the ball being fumbled for the Saints to pick it up within the 10-yard-line. While most thought that was a "fluke" as it never happened before, the Cardinals game started to raise some questions. The Cardinals game was mostly not Dickson's error but there was some fault to be put in his name. Nick Bellore, the special team captain who declares which people to block on punts, decided to leave a man unblocked as that play usually would be ineffective on most punts, but as said after, he publicly accepted his mistake. Bellore believed they could get away by leaving a rusher unblocked but that unblocked rusher tackles Dickson, knocking the ball out which was recovered for the Cardinal's only touchdown. If this play were to be a regular punt without any mishaps, the Seahawks would've held the Cardinals to an unacceptable 3 points on the day. The slight fault of Dickson comes from his ball security, as both times from both games when getting tackled in the backfield he had a little handle on the ball, allowing it to end up on the ground for the opponent to pick up. In the Saints game, it was taken for a touchdown in the following succession but in the Cardinals game, due to the lack of ball control, it ended up in the hands of a Cardinals player who scored a touchdown on that very given play.

2. Offensive Cooldown

   After a historic first 5 weeks with Geno Smith at the helm, and the former Jets' second-round pick leading the league in completion percentage and pass rating he finally cooled down. While Geno still leads the league with a 73.4% completion percentage, he now ranks third in passer rating, with 108.1, 1.8 behind the leader, Tua Tagovailoa, who has not played in 2 weeks. Even though he may have cooled down, he still maintains the same game, not throwing for any interceptions in the last 3 weeks for an INT% of 1.1%, second behind Tom Brady's 0.4%.

   

   Geno Smith Leading Statistics:

   

   4th in Average Yards Per Attempt (8.0)

   1st in Completion Percentage (73.4%)

   3rd in Passer Rating (108.1)

   10th in Yards Passed (1502)

   7th in TD% (4.8%)

   2nd in INT% (1.1%)

   5th in DVOA (21.8%)

   

   In other words, Geno Smith remains elite and even though his numbers may have dipped this week, he still does exactly what Waldron and Pete want of him, which happened to be not as much as the previous weeks.

   Kenneth Walker III is an absolute beast. Averaging 5.5 yards per carry, Walker ranks 7th in the NFL in total YPC this season. Per PFF Walker has accumulated 22 forced missed tackles this season on just 44 rushing carries. That percentage ranks the highest in the NFL through the first 6 weeks. Through numerous runs in the Cardinal's game, you could see Walker have 1-2 defenders on him and he was able to break free and run for extra yards. His best run was when there were 6 defenders within 2 yards of him and outmuscled and broke many of their tackles, turning what looked to be a 3-yard loss behind the line of scrimmage into a ferocious 21-yard-run. After fully off a monster 60+ yard run in the Saints game, Walker continued that trend with an 11-yard run that included a combination of a hurdle and stiff arm, juking the defender and allowing Walker to turn the edge and freely walk in. Walker looks to be the full 3-down back the Seahawks have needed and has capably filled Rashaad Penny's wide shoes with young, fresh legs.

3. Defensive Turnaround?

   The Seahawks played their most complete game of football and that was largely because their defense was able to communicate and function consistently. Poona Ford has the best game of his season recording a sack, a pass breakup, and 4 solo tackles. He consistently either beat his block or pushed the offensive line far enough back to have some effect on the play. Bryan Mone had arguably the best game of his career resetting the line of scrimmage back 2 yards almost every play. While a nose tackle almost never lights up the stat sheet, Mone's value was unprecedented as he opened up many opportunities for the rest of the team. Quinton Jefferson had the best game of his Seahawks tenure this season with 5 combined tackles and a 12-yard sack. Jefferson also used his agility releasing off his blocks and staying parallel with the run game, while also rushing inside on pass block snaps, including a play where he forced Murray to scramble inside where he ended up tackled by Nwosu for a sack. Shelby Harris also got in the action recording a sack, a pressure, and 4 total tackles. Boye Mafe, unable to record a pass rush statistic, continued to be phenomenal at setting the edge, even breaking through the offensive line on a goal-line play, forcing Kyler Murray out of bounds with the help of Michael Jackson. Another chapter of this great story was about Nwosu, who recorded a sack, a pressure, and 3 total tackles. The final, yet surprising piece of this revamped pass rush was Darrell Taylor. The former second-round pick has largely struggled in pass rush this year, having been only credited one sack in 5 games. Taylor in the past has rarely ever used his hands and speed and tends to only bullrush, the move that had shown limited effectiveness so far this season. Taylor had the best game of this season, using his elite agility and speed to bend the corner and get to the quarterback. He recorded a sack and also as mentioned previously bent the edge with lightning speed, knocking the ball out of Murray's hands to force a fumble that was recovered by an offensive lineman. If Taylor can learn how to use his speed more, and perhaps learn how to use his hands, he can continue to wreak havoc by forcing fumbles and taking down the quarterback.

   The Seahawks' former first-round pick Jordyn Brooks had his best game of the season as well having a day with double-digit tackles and allowing very few yards in coverage. This is a drastic improvement from the prior two weeks in which he allowed an 80% completion percentage and 160 yards total over the said duration. Part of the reason the defensive line and Jordyn Brooks were more effective today is that the Seahawks played 5-1-5, or nickel, meaning Cody Barton was off the field, allowing Brooks to be freer and do what he excelled at in college. They also seemed to run more 3-4, the personnel change they had worked on the entire offseason, but had only sporadically implemented throughout the first 5 weeks of the season. Continuing this may help this defense find its rhythm and play at a higher level, putting the best players on the field with the best opportunity to succeed.

   

   Barton's limited snaps also added an extra defensive back on the play, usually Ryan Neal with the occasional Josh Jones. This helped limit the passing game, including holding Murray to under 225 yards and 1 field goal. The Seahawks seemingly had no answers to the pass or run for the first 5 weeks of the season, but taking out Barton in exchange for an extra DB seemed to work and will most likely be utilized again from next week onwards. Part of the reason there are lots of reasons for improved success in the rookie corner tandem. Tariq Woolen continues to excel in coverage and tackling, posting another interception and 5 tackles. He allowed a mere 21 yards in coverage bringing his average receptions allowed per game to just over 2.3. Woolen has been a game-changer with his phenomenal tackling and coverage and his keenness to find the ball in the air, but the other rookie cornerback also performed exceptionally as well. Enter Coby Bryant, the rookie who forced his third straight fumble in the last three games. He posted 8 tackles on the day, his career high. His prior tackles in previous games were more tackles after he allowed a huge chunk of yards, but this game it was different as he seemed to tackle to make the play, not to stop extra yardage from an already large play. In total, excluding week 6, Bryant has allowed a 68.4% completion percentage for 55.4 yards per game. Week 6 was a drastic step forward as he allowed 3 receptions on 7 targets for a 42% completion percentage. Those 3 receptions went for a total of -1 yards! Bryant seemed to stay extremely tight in coverage, perhaps learning how to successfully and properly cover as a nickel corner. If Woolen and Bryant can continue to step up and develop while making plays, the Seahawks' secondary will continue to grow and become a lockdown unit with an X-factor ability in forcing turnovers.
