1. **Special Teams**

   

   With an improvement from last week, not fumbling to force the defense in the red zone, the Seahawks had an overall impressive game on punt and kick returns. Where they went wrong was with Myers, who missed an extra point. While this itself was not catastrophic its indirect consequences hurt the Seahawks in hindsight. The Seahawks, perhaps in an attempt to make up for the missed point, went for it on a 2-point conversion and failed with an incomplete pass toward DK Metcalf. In the grand result, the extra 1 through 3 points wouldn't have made a difference but at one point it would've when the score was 32-31 Seahawks with 5 minutes left in the game. If they had gotten 2 points from making and opting to take the extra points the game would have been 34-31 with a field goal needed to prevent the Seahawks from winning. Even if Myers still missed that extra point, if the Seahawks made the 2-point conversion there would still be a field goal difference in the Seahawks' favor. This may have not affected the outcome, even with under 6 minutes left in the game, but next time the Seahawks may not be so lucky and a series of events such as this one may cause the game to fall out of their hands.

2. **Defensive (In)capabilities**

   

   There were few positive pieces on this defense. For starters, Ryan Neal, as Seahawks Today suggested, played the majority of Josh Jones' snaps as starting SS and was a proficient tackler. It was evident the secondary was by far better with Neal in as the Saints were limited to a collective 209 yards. This may have been because the Saints found immense success running the ball, on the other hand, it may have been because they could not pass against the Seahawks' secondary, thus rushing 48 times. We do know the Seahawks' secondary was good, led by Tariq Woolen who recorded his third straight game with an interception, obtained his first fumble recovery, and officially has the 6th lowest passer rating allowed by any CB this entire year. Tariq Woolen is in contention for being one the highest-rated cornerbacks this season, and one of the clear favorites for Defensive Rookie of the Year. Another player who truly was effective was Al Woods, the 35-year-old defensive tackle who has shown no signs of slowing down. The only thing that had slowed him down was a knee injury that prevented him from coming back to the game, despite how badly he wished to. Before his injury, he was on a roll with 1 sack, 1 pressure, and 5 tackles, one of which came on a surprising stop of Taysom Hill. Finally, we get to Coby Bryant, the last player with a mostly positive impact on the defense. Bryant is slowly starting to emerge as a true starter for the nickel position. During the first few weeks, he allowed massive plays, either from pass interference or he simply got beat, but everything changed over the last couple of weeks. After allowing a combined XX amount of yards in coverage over weeks 1-3 he quickly turned things around only allowing XX from Weeks 4 and 5. Perhaps the more important change after Week 3 was his turnovers, in which he knocked the ball loose from opposing receivers and forced a fumble in the Lions' game and another during the Saints' game. If Bryant can continue to emerge he and Woolen may provide a fearsome duo in the backend of the defense. This marks the transition from the few bright spots on defense to the not-so-bright areas that have continued to get dimmer as each week progresses.

   To start off, it appears the Seahawks have a high school playing against NFL professionals because they allowed two 100-yard rushers, something never done in the Pete Carroll tenure. What makes this worse is one of the rushers had 4 combined touchdowns, 1 coming from the passing game while the other 3 all rushes. The aforementioned was Taysom Hill, someone who is a complete wildcard on offense, playing TE, QB, and RB. Anyone who watches the game and/or professionally watches film to gameplan for Hill should know almost 99% of the time he lines up the play will be a run, whether he hands it off or he takes it himself. Knowing this is a given and stayed true during the game against the Seahawks, the Seattle defense had 0 answers for him, allowing Hill to rush for 112 yards including a full-blown 60-yard touchdown run. As a fan and most likely from the sideline seeing Hill in the game and knowing exactly what will happen hurts beyond words knowing your defense can't stop him.

   

   Our pass defense is nothing special except for a few drive-changing plays, and looking closely our corners and safeties are playing well, resulting in us looking at a dormant pass rush that forces corners to cover for an extremely long, unnecessary time. In a season where we were expected to get massive production from our pass rush and more specifically Taylor, this has turned out to be a major disappointment. Uchenna Nwosu has a pass rush win rate of 11.26%, ranking 11th in the NFL, he has by far exceeded expectations and set his new career high. On the other hand, we have Darrell Taylor, the former second-round pick who was expected to get double-digit sacks but has largely missed every expectation. Nwosu needs Taylor to alleviate pressure in order for Nwosu's pressures to turn into sacks. Our linebackers played a little better but still struggle with communication and actual coverage. The entire linebacking core and defensive line need to turn around and show up if the Seahawks want Geno's unprecedented success to have value.

3. **Offensive Efficiency**

   

   Geno Smith has been an elite quarterback throughout this season, and the Saints game only enforced that. Something that had been missing from Geno's game was deep throws, but that all changed after a perfect beauty to Lockett in the endzone for a 41-yard touchdown seconds before the end of the first half. He even lofted another beauty toward Lockett during the first minute of the 4th quarter and completed the deep throw for a 40-yard touchdown to close the gap to 6 points. Geno, however, did have a "bad" day with a completion percentage of only posting 64% or an above-average number. That completion percentage remains higher than Wilson's average during the entire 2022 season. Geno Smith may truly be a CPOY or MVP candidate if he had a defense to help him close out the wins.

   Geno's life only got worse on Sunday after Rashaad Penny ended up with a season-ending injury, handing Geno's strong running game to the rookie Ken Walker III. We pray Rashaad Penny can get healthy and continue his elite prowess, but for now, Ken takes the reins. After Penny left the game with his injury, Walker showed his worth by taking a run to the house for a 65-yard touchdown, giving the Seahawks the lead by one point. Walker has all the room now to show he can be an every-down back, but he will need help for the offensive line if he wants to continue to do so. For now, Dallas will remain the 3rd down back as the replacement for Homer with his above-average hands and "good-enough" pass protection.

   

   With Rashaad Penny coming out and Penny Hart entering for 1 snap before leaving with a hamstring injury, it was not a pretty day for either position group. The Seahawks came with Penny, Walker, and Dallas entering the game, but left with 2 running backs, prompting the need to elevate or sign another running back to help thicken their depth. The wide receiver room also faced similar struggles with the only receivers being DK, Lockett, Eskridge, and Hart as Goodwin and Young both were inactive due to injury. After Hart left the game the Seahawks were left with only 3 receivers on the field, another weak position group in terms of depth. The Seahawks will also look to elevate someone, either JJ-Arcega Whiteside or Bo Melton, or sign someone to take place until Goodwin or the rest of the room becomes healthy.

   

   The Seahawks' offensive line has performed well and is 2nd in the NFL in pass block win rate at 67%, only trailing the Cleveland Browns. Geno is repeatedly able to have a clean pocket and whenever his pocket collapses is usually able to escape and make a play. The Seahawks have only allowed 9 sacks total, around the middle of the pack, averaging under 2 sacks a game. Having two tackles from an Air-Raid system doesn't help the run-blocking as clearly shown by the team's 69% run-block win rate, or 27th in the NFL. This has not prevented the Seahawks' running backs to not have high yards per rush average with Rashaad Penny averaging 6.1, Ken Walker averaging 6.3, and Dallas averaging 6.2. In total, the Seahawks average 5.5 yards per rush, which leads the NFL with this time the Cleveland Browns coming at third with 5.3 per attempt. The offensive line has exceeded all expectations as evidenced by their high pass-blocking and run-blocking statistics, which helps Geno Smith maintain composure and also opens up the play-action game. As mentioned previously, Rashaad Penny will be out meaning Geno will have one less weapon, but the real test will be to see if the Seahawks' run game can keep its high yards per attempt with Walker and Dallas as the main runners,

   even with their starter Penny out.

4. **The MVP of the Game**

   Without further ado, I mention the clear MVP of the game.

Oh yeah, and Alvin Kamara's in the picture.

The Seahawks had 0 calls come their way, practically costing them the game. From a horrendous Olave touchdown call in which he dropped the ball on impact with the ground, to Metcalf having an entire forearm down but it being called a fumble, there were many game-changing calls that made sure the Saints won. Another example was a beautiful touchdown that got wiped away to DK Metcalf because Charles Cross "held" the defender. In reality, Cross had his hands legally on the player's jersey but once he saw Geno roll out the defender flailed his arms warranting a flag, which killed the successful play. It seemed every time something happened the flag went in favor of the Saints, no matter how obvious the call was. Let's just hope that doesn't happen again against the Cardinals in Week 6 at home.
