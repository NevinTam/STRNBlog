**Offense Manages to Get the Job Done**
For the first time in the Geno Smith era, the Seahawks were able to finally finish the job and defeat the rival 49ers. Geno and the offense sputtered for most of the game, taking critical sacks that lengthened many of their scoring drives, including their first few field goals (one of them due to a Jonathan Hankins interception!). Going into the second half, however, Geno Smith gifted the 49ers free points after throwing an interception deep in Seahawks territory. However, after the injury to Nick Bosa on the following drive, the Seahawks were able to motor down the field in a timely manner, with several key 3rd down conversions before punching it in to give the Seahawks a fresh lead. Later in the 4th quarter, where the Seahawks were in a must score situation, they again failed to convert another short yardage scenario, leading to the 49ers to regain control with less than 4 minutes left in the game. If not for the defense, the offense likely would have ended the game right there. However, they were able to get the ball back quickly with over 2 minutes to go. This led to a masterful drive orchestrated by Geno Smith, who was able to march down the field and eventually rush into the endzone for the game clinching touchdown, finally ending the 49ers win streak over the Seahawks.

**Defense Comes Up Big**
The defense continued their improvement from the Rams game before the bye, looking radically improved in both the run and pass games. Purdy at often times had no clear read on where to throw the ball, forcing him to be dangerous and improvise. This still led to some points for the 49ers, especially on a 3rd quarter drive with Juan Jennings being the main utility weapon. However, besides these two touchdown drives, the defense played mostly lockdown as they prevented much of the Niners offensive gameplan. The Seahawks played excellent in forcing punts, and forced several critical ones including late in the game to give the ball back to the offense with time to score. If the Seahawks wish to become first in the NFC West, they should continue this defensive performance at home against the red-hot Arizona Cardinals.
