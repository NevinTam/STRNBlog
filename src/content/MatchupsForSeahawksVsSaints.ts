The Seahawks play the Saints for their second straight 10 AM PST road game (which they have now won 14 of the last 15) in New Orleans, This will be a true test to see if the offense can continue their success against a better defense in the Saints and a chance to see if the defense can improve from their disastrous showing against the injured Lions last week. Here are 5 matchups to watch in this week's game.

The main matchup here to watch will be DK Metcalf playing against Marshon Lattimore. When the 2 faced off last season, tensions ran high as multiple flags were called when the 2 argued in between plays. Metcalf is coming off a season-high 149-yard performance, 101 of which came against up-and-rising CB Jeff Okudah, who was able to limit other receivers like Justin Jefferson and Terry McLaurin. Lattimore is also coming off a notable game for all the wrong reasons. Lattimore gave up several clutch receptions to Justin Jefferson, allowing the Vikings to come back and ultimately win their game against the Saints in London. As for Lockett, he is off to another great start, totaling 91 yards last week and over 300 yards and 27 receptions over just 4 weeks. Adeebo has not played as well as his counterpart, as he has given up 92 yards, a completion percentage of 80%, and a passer rating of 138 through only 2 games, making him a possible liability for Geno Smith to exploit.

**2.Saints RB Alvin Kamara + Saints Offensive Line vs Seahawks Front 7**

Coming off another weak game on run defense, the Seahawks now must defend against one of the shiftiest running backs in the league in Alvin Kamara. Kamara is now active after missing one game last week against the Vikings. Before getting injured, he was averaging around 4 YPC while playing the Falcons and Panthers, both of whom play the run better than the Seahawks do. It will be critical for the Seahawks to keep Kamara contained on the inside and not allow him to bounce to the outside and into space, as when he does he could be gone for a touchdown. Key emphasis will be placed upon LBs Jordyn Brooks and Cody Barton specifically, as they have not made the impact expected of them in the run game. Brooks is not penetrating the backfield like he did last year, and Barton has consistently missed tackles in open space. Another key factor in run defense is the fact that second round pick Boye Mafe will get the start over Darell Taylor at OLB. This is significant as Mafe has played much better against the run than Taylor, who has given up several big plays while defending the run.

**3.Seahawks RB Rashaad Penny + Seahawks Offensive Line vs Saints Front 7**

In the same way the Seahawks rushing defense will be a key matchup, the rushing offense will be a key part of making the offense more consistent, especially in the second half. Through the first part of this season, the Seahawks are one of the best teams in the league in throwing the ball through the first half, ranking first in Dropback EPA/play. Whereas in the second half, they take a step back passing-wise, but instead focus on the run game, which becomes first in the league rushing EPA/play. This emphasizes the need for a strong run game for the Seahawks, especially in the second half. The Saints run defense has been a strong unit, allowing only 4.0 YPC through 4 weeks and above average in ESPN run-stop win rate. The Seahawks will need to continue to utilize Penny as he has been efficient throughout the season, even when he has not been given an increased workload, averaging 6 YPC on the season. Overall, a run game will be needed in order for the Seahawks offense not to collapse in the second half.

**4.Seahawks OTs Charles Cross + Abraham Lucas vs Saints DEs Cam Jordan and Marcus Davenport**

The Seahawks rookie tackle duo is off to a great start this season, with Lucas and Cross exceeding expectations many have set for them this season. Lucas has not given up any sacks this season and Cross has fared well outside of 2 sacks given up first game of the season. On the other side of the ball, however, the Saints DEs put lots of pressure last week on Kirk Cousins despite the low sack total. It will be necessary to keep Geno Smith upright to keep up the offensive rhythm and score points. Smith's fast release and short passing game should help with this.

**5.Saints WR Chris Olave vs Seahawks CBs Tariq Woolen and Michael Jackson**

Saints rookie receiver Chris Olave is off to a great start this season, totaling over 330 yards and 1 touchdown along with 21 receptions, making him a leader for the OROY award so far. The Seahawks likewise have a rookie sensation on their hands with Tariq Woolen, an athletic marvel who has played well to start the season out. Woolen has recorded several key plays such as a pick-six against Jared Goff and blocked field goal on special teams against San Francisco. Woolen has played good in coverage as well, as he is yielding a sub-50% completion percentage and a sub 40 passer rating, showing his potential at only 23. Michael Jackson has also played well so far, but has been exploited at times against bigger receivers, as shown in the week 3 game against Atlanta.
