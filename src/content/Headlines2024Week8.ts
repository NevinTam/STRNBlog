**Seahawks WRs vs Bills CBs**

The Seahawks will be without DK Metcalf for this game, who ranks near the top of receiving yards in the league for the team this year. Automatically, the Seahawks true deep threat at this point is time is gone, with Lockett not relying on speed anymore to get open, but route-running. And for Jaxon Smith-Njigba, he has shown an ability to get deep at times, but without elite speed he has been utilized more in the short game. Combine that with a lackluster offensive line, and the Seahawks will most likely need to rely on a short passing game to move the offense. The Bills, on the other hand, have one of the best defenses in the game. Rasul Douglas, Taron Johnson, and Christian Benford have all been quality players for a good defense this season. Knowing the Seahawks’ struggles to run the ball, the Bills will likely be able to be blitz-happy and help their secondary’s job by affecting the quarterback routinely. With no deep threat or speed to keep the defense honest and open up the offense, this could be a major struggle for the Seahawks who had a great bounceback game against the Falcons. If the Seahawks lose against the Bills, they would have lost 4 of their last 5 games, after starting the season 3-0 with quality play on both sides of the ball. Expect JSN or Lockett to be a focal point for the offense’s passing game as the Seahawks attempt to muster anything in the passing game.

**Seahawks DL vs Bills OL**
The Bills are known for their physical offensive line. They can protect long enough for Josh Allen to make deep balls, but also are a force in the run game and can move almost any defensive linemen routinely. The Seahawks, meanwhile, have Byron Murphy who appeared to have helped their run defense woes from earlier in the season. However, the Seahawks defensive line is known for the pass rush but against a physical offensive line against the Bills, this could be hard matchup for Seattle. If the Seahawks aren’t able to stop the run consistently, they won’t be able to pass rush freely and then in the chance that they decide to pass the ball instead of run it, the Seahawks would’ve been playing the run instead of the pass and then likely give up a big play. In other words, this matchup in the trenches between the Seahawks defensive line and the Bills offensive line could be what Seattle needs to help keep their offense without a star in the game. Expect the Bills, however, to run the ball frequently and often to open up the playbook later in the game. James Cook is a stout running back, but against a Seahawks defensive line that has struggled greatly in recent weeks, this could be a huge game for the 3rd-year-back and former Pro Bowler.
