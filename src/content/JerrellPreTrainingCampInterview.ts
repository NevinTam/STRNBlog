# **“Come in with the idea that ’I am gonna be better today’, and that’ll lead you all the way to the finish line”**
‎ 

**Michael Jerrell, star Findlay OT**, was recently drafted by the Seattle Seahawks in the 6th round of the 2024 NFL Draft. Michael has showcased elite athleticism at his position, something that led him to being the only D2 player taken in the entire draft. Following his selection in the draft, Michael has undergone a big transition period through the Seahawk’s rookie offseason program, starting with his experience through rookie OTA’s and minicamp.

    “when you first get there, you kinda feel like you never played football, because they throwin’ so much at you - plays, terminology, and technique … it can get overwhelming. You gotta take a breath and realize that it’s all the same. The moment I did that, the moment it started to get easier”

One of the numerous challenges that Michael has went through during this period was going from the one of the best players at Findlay to now working his way up the rookie depth chart at the NFL level.

To try and keep up with the countless years of experience ahead of him on the roster, Jerrell has turned to taking the initiative to try and keep pace.

    “Ask questions. Shoot one of your teammates a question. If I’m struggling with something, I’ll ask around. Everybody helps everybody”



This hasn’t been a struggle he’s had to bear alone, however. Michael mentions that he has received plenty of support from the rookie OL class, as well as several veterans.

    “From Curt, to Charles, Abe, George, and Laken. They’re always laying down a helping hand … the offensive line, as a unit, you can’t leave any man behind. Everybody on the offensive line group, they make sure that we’re getting better and not feeling left out”

Specifically, George Fant has been like a big brother to Michael in his transition to the NFL. Fant is actually the cousin of Michael’s Findlay captain and friend Yoseph Carter, who Michael played alongside the offensive line with.



Yoseph only played a year with Michael at Findlay, but Michael notes that he thinks Yoseph is on the right track to succeed at Findlay after reaching All-American honors last season. To the younger guys on the Findlay team, Michael reinforces that you have to buy into the Findlay culture.

    “You’re gonna have highlights. You’re gonna have lowlights, but just try to minimize the lowlights as much as possible … You might easily get discouraged, be low on the depth chart. I’m a guy who’s proven I had to climb my way to get a spot on the depth chart at the D2 level. I’ve been beat out of spots. I’ve not started. I’ve been benched before. Just don’t get too low on yourself. Come in with the idea that ‘I’m gonna be better today’, and that’ll lead you all the way to the finish line”



One of Michael’s favorite coaches that he credits for his success at Findlay is Coach Chad Wagner (known as Coach Wags), who is the Strength and conditioning coach at Findlay. He;’s been an integral part of many player’s stories - including Michael’s.

    “Coach Wags is a worker. He wants workers. From Coach Kory Allen and Coach Wags, their personalities, I get the same personalities from the coaches here, in Seattle. They both want workers…whatever the coach says is on the table, they do it, and they do it above and beyond. They want guys who run through a brick wall.”



When it comes to the Seahawks OL rookies, Michael mentions that they’ve done many things together, including going to various restaurants, going Mariners/Storm games, meeting Seahawks legends, bowling nights, etc. 

### (PS: If you’re ever at Legion Sports Bar, make sure you get the crab cakes - Michael )

Of all the rookie offensive linemen this year, Michael highlights Christian Haynes as someone he’s really connected to throughout the offseason program.



    “Me and Christian, we’ve been kicking it a good amount. Our rooms are right next to each other in the hotel, so we can get together, talk, chop it up a little bit. He’s been one of the people I’ve been getting connected with the most.”

Through the offseason program, Michael has been in contact with several new Seahawks coaches, including HC Mike Macdonald, OC Ryan Grubb, and OL Coach Scott Huff. Michael says that the new scheme implemented by Grubb has allowed OL to be versatile, later saying “There’s nothing that we shouldn’t be able to do”.



Jerrell has also frequently met with HC Mike Macdonald, who has brought a culture shift to the Seahawks identity, but this hasn’t been anything new for Michael.

    “His coaching style tough. He wants tough players, tough minded players. We’re buying in as a unit, we believe in what he wants … [Findlay HC Kory Allen] he’s the same type of coach. Tough minded players. Guys who want to come in and work. They want people with the mentality that ‘I get to do this today’ rather than ‘I’ve got to do this today’, having high energy coming in…[Macdonald] makes it a priority to keep people’s energy high”

The coaches are no stranger to keeping players energized. Jerrell describes most of the offensive coaching staff he’s met with as very energetic. 

    “They want to bring the best out of us all the time. Technical coaches want you always working on the basics … they’ve transitioned all our games. I’ve seen so much improvement from myself and my teammates in the short time I’ve been there”

When describing the scheme and type of playstyle Macdonald has implemented in Seattle Jerrell defines it as “explosive”

    “You want explosive plays on both sides of the ball, offense and defense. You want fumbles and interceptions and sacks. You want 60-yard runs and one play drives. I think our offense and defense are capable of both of these things”
