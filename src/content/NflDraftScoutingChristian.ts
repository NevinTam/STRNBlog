**Oregon Duck Christian Gonzalez' scouting report**

Hello SeahawksToday readers! I hope you aren't too devastated about the thorough beating the Niners gave us in the 2nd half of that game on Saturday. But now that our season is officially over, it's time to turn our attention to the mysteries of the offseason. And on a side note; I'm rooting for Joe Burrow and the Bengals to bring it home in the Super Bowl.

In the early morning hours of Sunday, tweets were going around with some of Pete Carroll's quotes from his weekly radio show. Coach Carroll talked about hating the inconsistency within our front 7, specifically our defensive line, and how it was a big point for improvement in the offseason. I know plenty of Seahawks fans probably agree with him, but in today's draft profile, we'll be doing a complete 180-degree turn. We will be looking at Oregon cornerback prospect Christian Gonzalez.

To those who know me, you will know that cornerback is my favorite position to watch. I also have a chronic bias for them, and every year I will be clamoring for the Seahawks to draft one within the first round. However, I also know the front office's history with corners; the current Seahawks leadership has never drafted a corner higher than the 3rd round. But today you will enter my dreamland as I delve into a cornerback that I believe should be the first corner off the board come April.

But before we get into his profile, let's talk about the current state of our CB room. Tariq Woolen has become one of the faces of our defense in his rookie year, and I expect him to ascend exponentially within the years to come. But to me, the CB2 position is still a precarious situation. Mike Jackson has been performing above expectations this year, and I am not averse to keeping him on the team. However, I think that the depth of round 1 cornerback talent in this draft provides us with an excellent chance to grab an elite talent to play alongside Tariq Woolen with our 2nd first-round pick.

Building a strong D-line is tough to do in 1 offseason, and it likely will take more than one elite player to take our defensive line up to the level that the Niners are at. But with the CB position, you can upgrade instantly with one draft pick or free agent signing. Look at how Sauce Gardner has elevated the Jet's defense this season (albeit they already had some talent on their defensive line). I also have been a big believer in great defenses having a strong CB duo. Some examples include; Darious Williams and Jalen Ramsey for the Rams last year; DJ Reed and Sauce Gardner for the Jets this year; Marlon Humphrey and Marcus Peters for the Ravens.

Christian Gonzalez is a player that will provide a lockdown presence opposite Tariq Woolen. This will help Woolen out as he is still learning the ropes of the cornerback position. I do not think he is a shutdown guy yet, as he has a lot to improve in his ability to win at the line of scrimmage. Gonzalez on the other hand is already technically sound, with a great frame and elite athleticism. His ball skills are second to none in the class. Let's look at my scouting report below:

Strengths:

-Throughout his collegiate years he has played outside CB and in the slot.

-Gonzalez is explosive off the snap, which allows him to quickly get in phase with the receiver. Shows great footwork and fluid hips when in transition.

-He will always be competing at the catch point. Gonzalez has superb ball skills and it shows in his ball production.

Shortcomings:

-Gonzalez should work on being quicker with route anticipation while he is in zone coverage or playing off the line.

-Although he is a willing tackler, I would like to see Gonzalez be more physical when taking on blocks in the run game.

Summary:

Christian Gonzalez is an enticing prospect for teams looking to make a big addition at CB in the NFL draft. His elite athleticism is backed up by solid technique and production, making for a player that can contribute to a defense on day 1. He does have a few things to work on to make him a more well-rounded player, but with the type of film Gonzalez has, his name should be up there in the conversation for the top corner in the draft.

**Numerical Grade: 90.5/100**

**Projection: Floor - Quality Starter -----\> Ceiling - Perennial All-Pro**

**Round Grade: Top 15**
