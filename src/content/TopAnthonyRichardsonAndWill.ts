***Anthony Richardson: QB***

***Florida - 6'4 - 232 LB***

Games watched: vs LSU (2022), Georgia (2022), Tennessee (2022), Utah (2022)



Grading Scale:  

![](https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/671495d5-2d86-4880-b955-873e4699da84_877x640.png)

Anthony Richardson Grade:  

![](https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/de84dc07-d26d-4d0e-94c1-9a7e0e33c434_866x270.png)

Strengths:

-Richardson is electric outside the pocket. He has the twitchiness and athleticism to make defenders miss in space but also the ability to make pinpoint off-base throws

-He has shown the ability to throw with touch and great accuracy when going deep

Shortcomings:

-Richardson is inconsistent in his accuracy on intermediate throws. I believe this comes from his lack of consistent throwing mechanics and his elongated throwing motion

-He shows some of the common problems among inexperienced college QBs; poor field vision; questionable decision-making; not progressing through his reads; poor anticipation

Summary:

Anthony Richardson will be one of the most interesting and polarizing prospects of the 2023 draft cycle. He has all the tantalizing traits of a franchise quarterback, but his lack of playing experience has often shown on the field against SEC competition. But let's look at his pros first. He brings great athleticism and mobility to the equation, along with his cannon-like arm strength. His big frame will also have front offices clamoring to draft him. Richardson has developed great off-base accuracy as well as deep accuracy, but his accuracy on short-medium throws can be coached up. Teams will also have to fix his throwing mechanics as well as improve his ability to process the field. But with Richardson, the sky is still his ceiling. Teams should still be willing to take Anthony Richardson within the top 10 picks.

**Numerical Grade: 78.5/100**

**Projection: Floor - Backup Player -----\> Ceiling - Franchise Cornerstone**

**Round Grade: Round 1**

**Will Anderson Jr.'s Scouting Report:**

***Will Anderson Jr: EDGE***

***Alabama - 6'4 - 243 LB***

Games watched: vs Tennessee (2022), Cincinnati (2021), Texas (2022), Texas A\&M (2022), LSU (2022), Ole Miss (2022), Arkansas (2022), Miss St (2022)



**Grading Scale:**

Will Anderson Jr. Grade:  

![](https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/b3e8397e-30d5-4cdb-8416-4cb57a24d0b7_766x332.png)

**Background:**

Anderson is from Hampton Georgia, and was a four-star prospect who had nearly 40 offers coming out of high school. He started all 3 of his years at Alabama, totaling 34.5 sacks and 62 tackles-for-loss. Anderson was the recipient of the 2022 Bednarik award, while also becoming the first player in Alabama history to become a two-time unanimous All-American.

**Strengths:**

-He plays with heavy hands and is always strong at the point of attack. Very strong lower body; able to convert speed to power with dangerous potency

-Anderson has flashed the ability to string together moves to win on the edge

-Run defense: You will see him stack up to blockers and proceed to shed them with ease. Consistently holds the edge and shows good instincts and awareness to find the play

Anderson popped off the screen at Alabama with his explosiveness off the snap. He has a great first step, and his speed/bend combo on the outside is always a threat to offensive tackles. This also allowed him to either counter back inside or generate power to win with his bull rush. That bull rush proved to be one of Anderson's biggest strengths, due in part to his great lower-body strength and prototypical arm length. Besides the bull rush, Anderson showed many instances of great hand usage on tape. He has plenty of moves in his arsenal and flashes some moments where he was able to string together multiple moves to win a rep. He also set himself apart in his run defense. Anderson has great play strength and had no trouble shedding blockers and securing the edge. On top of that he showcased great instincts and awareness to find and make plays in the run game.

**Shortcomings:**

-Anderson needs to work on consistently rushing with a plan to win

While Anderson has done a good job honing his pass-rush and hand technique, he still does not consistently rush with a plan in mind. When his first move doesn't work he often doesn't have a counter ready. In the run game, he can sometimes be overzealous when pursuing a big play/TFL, and he won't maintain gap discipline. maintaining gap discipline. Besides polishing his game, teams will have Anderson's lighter frame to consider when deciding how he fits into their scheme. sometimes being overzealous when pursuing run plays and not maintaining gap discipline.

**Summary:**

Will Anderson Jr. is the godsend of this draft class. He pairs an enticing frame (34+ inch arms) with elite athleticism and great play strength to create a top-tier edge prospect. He has an explosive first step and can beat tackles with his speed + bend on the outside. Anderson does well converting his speed to power and using his relentless motor to get to the passer. In terms of refinement, Anderson shows solid technique and development in his pass-rush moves, but he will need to work on consistently rushing with a plan at the next level. In run defense, you won't find a prospect better than Anderson, although he could add a bit more weight to his frame. With that said, I can confidently say that he should be the first edge rusher taken off the board in the draft.

**Numerical Grade: 91.5/100**

**Projection: Floor - High-End Starter -----\> Ceiling - Franchise Cornerstone**

**Round Grade: Top 5**
