The Seahawks play the San Francisco 49ers on TNF this week in a matchup that will most likely cement the division if the 49ers win, or give the Seahawks a chance to still win the division if they can beat the 49ers. Here are 5 key matchups for Thursday's game.

**1. Nick Bosa vs Seahawks Offensive Line**

The Seahawk's rookie tackle duo has exceeded expectations, performing average to even above average, allowing the Seahawk's offense and Geno to thrive this season. They will now be up against one of the best edge rushers in the league in Nick Bosa, who will need to be stopped or at least negated in a big way if the Seahawks need to keep offensive consistency. Bosa has been one of the best pass rushers this season, totaling 14.5 sacks,15 tackles for loss, and 35 quarterback hits, truly indicating how tough of a matchup this will be for the Seahawk's young tackle duo. In the previous game against the 49ers, Bosa had 2 sacks and a TFL, proving to be disruptive even when the rookie tackle duo wasn't matched up against him, as both of those sacks were against the interior offensive line.

**2.** **Seahawks Rushing Attack vs 49ers Front 7**

With Rookie RB Kenneth Walker back after missing the last week against the Panthers, it will be all the more critical for the Seahawks to be able to establish an efficient rushing attack. This will be difficult for the Seahawks, who have struggled to have a strong run game for the past several weeks, but for this game even more so as they go against one of the best defenses in the NFL at stopping the run. However, as seen in the most recent Panthers game, the run game will be needed for the offense to keep pressure off Geno and allow him to play his normal game. With RB DeeJay Dallas out, the Seahawks will also need 3rd-down back Travis Homer to be the primary RB2, with him catching passes and providing effective pass-protection for Geno.

**3. Seahawks Front 7 vs 49ers Rushing Attack**

While the Seahawk's rushing attack has been anemic for the past few weeks, the 49ers have one of the best rushing attacks in the league with Christian McCaffery and their offensive line playing well as of late, including star LT Trent Williams. The Seahawks on run defense have played oppositely - allowing opposing teams to gash them in the run game repeatedly, most recently to the Panthers who had over 190 yards rushing and as an effect, a comfortable lead in the time of possession battle. If the Seahawks wish to limit their time on the field and the efficiency of the 49ers 49er'sse, they will need to stop the run game, which may be even more difficult if Al Woods is inactive.

**4. Seahawks Tight Ends vs 49ers Linebacker Core and SS Talanoa Hufanga**

A main staple of the Seahawks offense has been establishing the short passing game through the usage of tight ends. As time has passed, however, the Seahawks have struggled to incorporate this aspect in recent weeks, relying more and more on Geno, to the point where it is leading to many mistakes. If the Seahawks reestablish their tight ends, it will be tough as they will go against one of the linebacker groups in the league, led by Former All-Pro Fred Warner, who is one of the best coverage linebackers in the game. In the secondary, the 49ers also have a budding star in Talanoa Hufanga, who has played exceptionally well for them, creating many big plays early in the season.

**5. Geno Smith vs the 49ers Secondary**

Geno Smith had maybe his worst game of the season last week against the Panthers, as he was constantly looking to make a deep play to get out of the early 17-0 hole the Seahawks were in. This led him to take this aggressive playstyle which nearly led him to having 3 interceptions in one game. If the Seahawks wish to be able to consistently execute efficiently on offense, they will need to depend on Geno to play his natural game by taking what's there with check-downs if its there, while having a stout run game to relieve pressure on Geno and keep consistency on offense.
