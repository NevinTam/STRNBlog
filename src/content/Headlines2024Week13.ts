**Seahawks WRs vs Jets CBs**
Wide Receiver Jaxon Smith-Njigba has been elite the last 3 weeks. After posting back-back-back games with more than 100 receiving yards, he followed that up with 77 yards and a touchdown. Against a tough Jets secondary, headlined by Sauce Gardner, former Seahawks’ CB DJ Reed, and CB Michael Carter, Jaxon Smith-Njigba looks to continue his excellence as the Seahawks head east to Metlife Stadium. DK Metcalf has also put up solid games in return from his injury, averaging 65~ yards and 6~ receptions in the two games he has played after his last game in October against the Falcons. Sauce Gardner is one of the league’s best corners and may be a difficult matchup for DK Metcalf due to his ability to contest physical receivers like Metcalf and allow little separation. DJ Reed is another good cornerback for the Jets, who was on the Seahawks for 2 seasons. Reed is a standout corner and will also provide a tough matchup for JSN or Tyler Lockett, depending on the chosen alignment of Reed and the pair of Seahawks wide receivers. Metcalf had 3 yards on 1 reception against the Jets in 2022, Sauce Gardner’s rookie year. With a stout pass rush headlined by Will McDonald IV and Quinnen Williams, the Seahawks may not have enough time to get the ball to their playmaking wide receivers. The Seahawks are starting Laken Tomlinson, Olu Olu, and Sataoa Laumea across their interior offensive line. Against a player like Williams, this may be a hard game for the Seahawks and Geno Smith to get the ball to their wide receivers.

**Seahawks DL vs Jets OL**
The Seahawks defensive line has put up 3 impressive games against opposing teams, most notably stopping the run. Star running back Breece Hall for the Jets has put on an impressive series of games after starting out the season slow. He also presents himself as a potential pass-catching threat, posting 7 receptions against the Colts a week ago. While the Seahawks defensive line has been able to stop opposing rushers, they’ve been limited in their pressures and sacks. The Jets offensive line has some talent, but with Rodgers often appearing limited in his movement, any pressure he faces often creates immense trouble for him. With speedy and strong EDGEs in Boye Mafe, Derick Hall, and Dre’Mont Jones, they should create trouble for Rodgers by forcing him to escape the pocket and giving him very little time. The acquisition of Ernest Jones, Tyrice Knight starting, Dre’Mont Jones playing well, and an overall chemistry between the defensive line and front-7 have fueled this defense to their best performances all season. With Left Tackle Tyron Smith expecting to be ruled out, the Seahawks should be able to capitalize against rookie Olu Fashanu. Byron Murphy II, the Seahawks 2024 first-round draft pick, has had a quiet season statistically in the box score but has been extremely valuable in the last few weeks for his major impacts in run defense as well as taking up double teams. Leonard Williams looks to build upon his 2.5 sack performance against the Cardinals.
