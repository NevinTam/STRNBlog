**Offensive Inconsistency**

After a sizzling first TD drive led by Drew Lock (Geno Smith was inactive due to a groin injury), the Seahawks offense was quiet for most of the game until it the gap was 2+ scores. The Seahawks had another promising drive cut short in the redzone and had to settle for a field goal after 2 huge Charbonnet runs. The Seahawks couldn't run the ball much after this drive and couldn't move the ball consistently with Drew Lock, who had several turnover-worthy plays that led to him recording 2 INTs on the day. Overall, the offense couldn't really function without Geno Smith today, as the Seahawks couldn't get any consistency from their weapons outside of Tyler Lockett, who had a nice bounce-back game after a huge drop against the Cowboys. He recorded 89 yards on 8 receptions, a highlight in what has been a substandard season than what we are used to.

If the Seahawks are to continue to roll with Drew Lock into next weeks MNF matchup with the Eagles, they must seek to limit turnovers and run the ball efficiently, as without it they lack a key offensive identity.

**Defensive Ineptitude**

The Seahawks defense started allowing a 70+ rush by Christan McCaffery on the first play of the game. That's not good. It's demoralizing to see how far this team has fallen since their 5-2 and NFC West title aspirations at the midpoint of the season. The allowed explosive after explosive against the Niners as they were able to pull away in the 2nd and 3rd quarters, all but shutting the door on their NFC West Title (that the Seahawks had little hope ot get anyway). If the Seahawks are to improve going into MNF, they have to be able to limit the huge explosives in teh passing and rushing game.

In this game, it felt that it wasn't even the outside CBs that got torched, but rather the play of LBs and Safeties. Wagner got abused in coverage, and Jamal Adams let up a huge explosive TD to Deebo Samuel when he got caught flat-footed. Even the best performer in the Safety group, Julian Love, forced 2 turnovers (INT and FF) but let George Kittle run by and catch an easy touchdown when he got tricked by a play-action concpet.
