**Rough Outing from Geno and Co. - But they get the W**

Geno had a rough one against the Browns. He had two picks (one of which could be chalked up to an incredible play by a DT) and one dropped pick-six. He had an incredible first 3 drives, moving efficiently and scoring 17 pts through the early second quarter. After that, though, the offense slowed down for the next 7 drives, either punting or having a costly turnover occur. Many of Geno's throws were often off target, especially to WR DK Metcalf, who had a whopping 14 targets but was only able to haul in 5 of those. Lockett had a great bounce-back game, recording over 80 yards and one touchdown. JSN keeps up his great 3-week stretch with another touchdown in a clutch moment to drive the Seahawks to the top of the division.

Another reason why the offense stagnated was the Seahawks refusal to run the ball, despite great results. The Seahawks were able to chain several huge runs throughout the game from both Walker and Charbonnet but abandoned the run game for several long stretches at a time. It wasn't until the Seahawks second-to-last drive that they started to utilize Charbonnet more and be more consistent. Charbonnet also played great in pass protection, which is great for his 3rd-down back skillset that the Seahawks are currently using him in. The Seahawks have mainly used Kenneth Walker as their lead back this season, with Charbonnet coming into the mix, but last week proved to be a stark difference from earlier in the season. Zach Charbonnet actually outsnapped Walker, perhaps due to the inefficiency of Walker's running throughout the season as he chooses to go away from where the play is designed. Regardless of the semantics of who is starting, both backs were very efficient, recording close to 9 yards per carry against what seemed to be

The Offensive Line played very well today. They were able to keep the pressure off Geno for the most part against one of, if not the best, defensive lines in the league with players like Myles Garrett, Zadarius Smith, Sheldon Richardson, etc. They allowed just one sack to Myles Garrett and were able to open up rushing lanes for Walker and Charbonnet in their limited uses.

**Strong Defensive Game**

The Seahawks had another strong outing against a top-5 offensive line, winning the game for a Seahawks team that did not have an offense on the field for the 2nd and 3rd quarters. They held the Browns to a 40% third down convertage, a far better number than their games earlier in the season. While they allowed 385 yards total and 155 on the ground, they held opposing ball carriers to around only 4 yards per carry. PJ Walker had 248 passing yards, but under a 50% completion percentage and had 2 interceptions. While the box numbers show a weak game from the Seahawks defense, Walker got most of his passing yards on screen plays during a day the Seahawks were terrible at defending them. Taking out screenplays for the Browns, the Seahawks were completely dominant throughout the entire day and would have most likely kept the Browns offense under 250 yards on the day.

Of the Seahawks 155 yards allowed on the ground, many were big chunk plays that were uncharacteristic of a stout Seahawks run defense. In all, Seattle defended the run well but allowed a few big plays that boosted the average and rushing totals. The Seahawks were able to keep a star WR in Amari Cooper in check, only allowing him 6 receptions for 89 yards without any touchdowns. The one person the Seahawks had major trouble keeping in check was David Njoku who had 4 catches and 77 yards, including a touchdown. While most of his yardage came on one drive due to a bad scheme, Seattle needs to be better. Nevertheless, they did readjust their scheme to cover the middle of the field, and Njoku remained quiet after, but they should not be having uncharacteristically bad drives in their games because those drives are what keep the other team in the game, even if it is only for one drive.   

Past Seattle's coverage and ability to defend the run in the game, they had a monster game pass-rush-wise against a consensus top-5 offensive line. For reference, they recorded 14 pressures, their most on the season besides their 11-sack outing against the Giants. This, however, maybe even more impressive because this was an extremely talented Browns offensive line that let PJ Walker be constantly under duress. The team had 3 sacks on the day; one by Jordyn Brooks who is having a career year in coverage, defending the run, and as a pass rusher; one by Darrell Taylor who, while struggling in defending the run; has been a strong pass rusher, especially in absence of Uchenna Nwosu; and Boye Mafe, who recorded his 5th game in a row with a sack, totaling for him 5 sacks in 6 games played.
