The Seahawks (5-3) play the Cardinals (3-5) this week in Arizona. This will be the chance for the Seahawks to knock off their divisional rival from the divisional race, and most likely the playoff race as well. Even in a weaker NFC, going 3-6 does not bode well for the future after the Cardinals extended their GM, Steve Keim, Head Coach, Kliff Kingsbury, and QB, Kyler Murray. Below are 5 matchups for this game that will be critical for either team to win.

Coming into this game, the Cardinals run defense is currently ranked 17th in average YPC. In their most recent game against the Seahawks, the Cardinals allowed Walker to gain 4.6 YPC and a touchdown in a defensive game where every yard and point mattered. They also recently allowed Dalvin Cook have over 100 yards on a more efficient workload, averaging 5.5 YPC. The Seahawks will need Walker to make much of his yardage after contact if the Cardinals dominate the line of scrimmage as they did the last time these 2 teams played.

**2. Seahawks CBs Tariq Woolen, Coby Bryant, and Michael Jackson vs Cardinals WRs Deandre Hopkins, Rondale Moore, and Robbie Anderson**

The Cardinals now have star WR Deandre Hopkins after he was suspended for the first 6 weeks of the season. He has been on a tear after coming back, totaling over 250 yards and 22 receptions through only 2 games. In these 2 games, the Cardinals offense has also improved, averaging 27 points in their last 2 games. This will be the greatest test so far for Woolen, who is making noise for the DROY award after excelling for the Seahawks at RCB. Bryant played well against Moore in their last matchup, as Bryant only gave up 2 completions for 10 yards all game. Limiting the shifty Moore will be key in stopping the consistency of the Cardinals offense, along with stopping the run.

**3. Seahawks WRs DK Metcalf and Tyler Lockett vs Cardinals CBs Byron Murphy and Marco Wilson**

Both of the Seahawks WRs have recently come off injuries, with Lockett dealing with a hamstring injury and Metcalf dealing with a patellar tendon injury. They were questionable last week and were limited in practice at the beginning of the week. Last time these 2 went against the Cardinals, they had their least production in their last game against the Cardinals, where the offense as a whole was inconsistent. The Seahawks will need to keep Geno Smith upright so he is able to utilize this duo against Murphy and Wilson, who are coming off a good performance against another star duo in Justin Jefferson and Adam Thielen.

**4. Seahawks LBs Jordyn Brooks, and Cody Barton + Seahawks SS Ryan Neal vs Cardinals QB Kyler Murray**

The Seahawks, in their last matchup with the Cardinals, gave 100 yards to Kyler Murray on scrambles, allowing him to make some clutch conversions to move the chains. The Seahawks improved upon this last week against another mobile QB in Daniel Jones. Jones was coming off a 100-yard game rushing against the Jaguars and against the Seahawks he only had 20 yards off 6 carries. The Seahawks will have to keep this type of performance up against Kyler, who is coming off a minimal scrambling performance against the Vikings. Keeping Kyler contained in the pocket will allow the revitalized pass-rush to hit home and stop the Cardinals passing attack.

**5. Seahawks LBs Jordyn Brooks and Cody Barton + Seahawks SS Ryan Neal vs Cardinals TE Zach Ertz**

The Seahawks coverage against tight ends has somewhat improved after giving up almost 180 yards and two touchdowns to Lions (now Vikings) TE TJ Hockenson. They will have to keep up this level of play against Ertz, who is 2nd on the Cardinals for yards, receptions, and touchdowns. Ertz last time against the Seahawks had 7 catches for 70 yards and several key conversions. The Seahawks will need to limit him to stop the offensive consistency of the Cardinals.
