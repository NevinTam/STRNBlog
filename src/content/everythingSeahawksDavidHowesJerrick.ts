**ST**: What is one life lesson you teach to football players and anyone in general they should keep for their life?

**D**: No matter what level you are at, make sure your words match your actions. Integrity, making sure you do something when you say you're going to do it. We teach every single day worth ethic which is something you put on your work hat and go to work and make sure you say something and act with your words. Lots of life lessons football parallels life in so many different ways and making sure your words and actions make you get better and get through all the obstacles of life and football. Understanding your role on the team and making sure you get better and making sure you better the team versus just yourself. To answer your question, so many diff lessons to be taught in football and life. Words, actions, and integrity make you successful in the game of life.

**Summary:**At UNM, Coach Howes mentions how an important value they teach is making your words match your actions and showing integrity with a strong work ethic. These lessons can not only be applied to football, but also to obstacles within your entire life and the lives of others around you, overall making you successful in life.

**ST**: You mentioned a lot of obstacles, what are the biggest obstacles for players you coach to get through the college process?



**D**: Most of these guys aren't local, off in a state they've never been exposed to, from Mississippi or Florida to New Mexico, its a culture shock because not only the environment because in the Midwest where its mountains and not a lot of water, but a culture shock and moving here is difficult. Other times, family because of the involvement of their family or the lack of involvement with their family. Obviously financial obstacles. The biggest one can be females and relationships. Society today and the challenges of today and the problems of having to choose a side and not being able to be flexible to have a well-informed decision and this society forces you to make a decision politically, religiously, or every single controversial topic and forces a lot of obstacles for these people that come in beyond football. Academic obstacles such as, " do we learn as easily as others?", "Are the classes and the paths chosen for these guys the right paths for them to have an opportunity to graduate and not just to play football and have football as your avenue versus football using you?". There are a lot of obstacles and you can talk about just playing football. Everyone comes from schools where they're the best, but now everyone on this team is now equal and you need to fight every single day for your opportunity and you don't have the luxury to take your foot off the gas in any of those categories, so obstacles are deep especially when your away from home and your family and support systems and these guys have a lot of challenges to work through and as a coach, it's our role to offer them the support they leave to come play for. So when you recruit these guys our words and actions have to meet and when we talk to families and support systems and we say we are here to support them and we are here to help them and get them thru life, vs getting them just in the league and playing. A lot of those obstacles and challenges we have to help them work through and not overwhelm them and keep them on track.

**Summary:**A big obstacle for players in the college process is being introduced to a new environment away from family or friends. Other obstacles include academic obstacles, financial obstacles, or societal obstacles with relationships or friends. Now once you are in college, you go from being on a school where you were the best to being on a team where everyone was a best, which emphasizes how difficult these obstacles can be on top of that pressure. We have to support them and help them get through life and not just into the league.

**ST** : What would you say was your biggest challenge becoming a coach at New Mexico.  

**D**: Again, culture shcok coming from a 6a cham\[ionship level team moving to a college where the game is faster, players are much faster, and the bigggest change is being resposible for 160-175 players and staying in my lane and focusing on a group of specialists of safeties that were around 25 guys. When I got there i let myself go and focused on the entire team and gained some weight and wasnt in great shape and when i came to coach at UNM I had to reinvent myself and get back in teh gym and lose some weight and run and get myself in order and needed to focus on myself. I needed to spend time to make sure i could keep up with these guys. Number 2, I got here on the field and I was chirping my whistle on 7 and 7 players and HC GOnzales says what are you doing, and I said im killing the player, and he said swallow the whislte your not the head coach. I had to quickly learn I had a lane to fdocus on and I havent had my whistel for 4 years i say that jokingly, bumt i had a lane as an assistant coach and i needed to find where my priorties lie in those 25 playrs i was repsonsible fpor day in and day out and support gonzales vision and do everything possible to make this team successful.

**Summary:**Going from coaching 160-175 players to coaching my group of specialists or safeties that were around 25 players. I also had to focus on myself and lose some weight when I first joined UNM, which allowed me to keep up with these guys. As part of me coaching a much smaller group of players, I had to learn how to stay in my own lane and not interfere with other coaches, I had to learn how to support the vision Coach Gonzales had to make this team successful.

**ST**: Focusing on Jerrick Reed and the Seahawks, what was Reed's more impressive trait about his mentality?

**D**: Reed is one of those guys who is so impressive to watch every day whether it be class, special teams practice, safety room practice, meaning in the film room, or getting out to practice, prioritizing every day and not getting overwhelmed. Not letting anything consume his next step. Jerrick's morning started at 5:30 and he started with treatment. Then he would go with special teams and sit there and when you watched him there mouthing all the responsibilities of him and everyone else around him on punt and kickoff returns and he run the game with himself while others try to just stay attentive he was playing the game. Laser focus at 7, 7:30 film for an hour with the safeties, every single step of the day he prioritized and he had no problem w/ that because he was meticulous and would go to position meeting then practice then academics then treatment. He lived in the training room in a good way, plan with Bob Waller and everything he was doing. Reed is special because he was very calculated as he hiked on a rocky cliff and others would fall off but he was calculated to make sure he had good solid footwork or foundation to make sure he stayed safe when doing the right stuff. His everyday focus and approach to every single step including the adversities he faced he never allowed things he had adversity and challenges but he took them one step at a time with a calculated approach those things didn't overwhelm him and he never had a panic button on or off the field because he approached his day and prioritized his day as things handled accordingly.

**Summary:**Reed is the type of player that is extremely dedicated and has a strong work ethic, working continuously from the morning at 5:30 in the training room, special teams meetings, and film room for hours. His everyday focus and approach to his day shows his ability to not letting his responsibilities overwhelm him on or off the field.

**ST**: Is there a specific example where Reed overcame adversity at UNM?

**D**: Biggest adversity he came from junior college w/o offers and not by luck but Jordan Peterson the former safety coach at UNM now at Kansas found Jerrick and I credit him for that and Coach Bob Davey cleared and brought him in so his biggest adversity was being getting the opportunity. Get a place at the table to eat and that's what he did, but once he got to UNM he shifted from Mississippi life to establishing his worth in UNM and he did that then he changed his safety coach 4 times in succession and those are tremendous challenges. We aren't even talking about him leaving his strong support system in Mississippi to be here by himself. Blended with Patrick Pete and other guys here for a couple of years he could lean on. Calculated approach against adversity where he had not been given an opportunity and he could've gave up, then he starts playing and has individual success and spends the next 3 years struggling with teams with cultural issues and problems as teams go and he wanted to be a part of culture change and loyalty and stick with it and he could've left like other kids for much less but he never bounced. Talks about his character and drive for his plan and his plan from the beginning to the end of UNM and he had his plan for what he wanted to do with his degree, internships, training for the NFL, and Pro Day. Everything was part of the plan but you need to know when you have a defense that was ranked top 30 in many categories and an offense that was struggling mightily and others might bounce but he never did for something easy and helped support everyone around him to make it a marriage of success. He only had adversity this whole time and you wouldn't have guessed it because he had fellowship with him and around him you wouldn't guess he was overwhelmed and challenged, you would've have guessed his team was 12-0 and ready for college football playoffs. He was never shook and invaluable in my room a couple of years ago when we are trying to get everyone to buy in and work the culture change and get the Lobo type of guys Jerrick helped with that process but he felt he was on an island and wasn't sure what to do but stayed true to his morals and plan and that is as coaches and players we should all take note of sticking with the plan and process and do what's positive and make the organization successful.

**Summary:**The biggest adversity for Jerrick was coming from a Junior college with no offers, no opportunity to prove himself to bigger colleges. Coach Petersen and Davey gave him an opportunity and allowed him to transition from Mississippi to UNM. He could've given up with the adversity he came with being separated from his support group but instead he kept working and got individual success while the team itself was struggling finding an identity. He could've left then but instead he chose to stay and be a part of the new identity we have here at UNM. His drive, character made him focused on his goals and he never seemed fazed or overwhelmed. This was a key part of our culture and Jerrick helped greatly in that process. He stuck to the plan and the process and helped make a positive impact on this organization.

**ST**: What would you say is Reed's biggest asset as a player with his skill set?

**D**: His football IQ is off the chain, watching his film and the way he prepares his NFL stuff. you watch Ray Lewis's stuff as he comes through the league and he watches film he knew plays before they happened pre-snap and Reed is the same way in the way he communicates and works and prepares all from preparation and is so intelligent not only in internships and academics but also in conversations talking to everyone in the room and as a safety communicating with everyone as safeties and LBs around him and developing the rapport that is clear and concise and that's what he's gonna do. His biggest niche is his football IQ and prep cause he will do well and that's why Seattle people rave about him because they hear him talk and see he's different than most people. So many people have all these blinders up in society that they are held back, but Reed doesn't. He's flexible well rounded high football IQ fast quick on his feet. He's gonna find the football if it comes near him. So much more physical in the run game. Now just a powerful player.

**Summary:**Reed's biggest asset as a player is his IQ. The way he prepares by watching film and using it pre-snap is elite. He is extremely intelligent, not just in academics or internships, but just when having a conversation and communicating to those around him. One of his biggest strengths is that while many people have blinders up in society, hiding their true thoughts or ideas, Reed doesn't have these blinders. He's also a very physical, powerful player, which can be seen in the run game especially.

**ST**: How have u seen Reed go from the day you met him to the day he has been drafted?

**D**: Back to your last question, some of that. growth came from humility as he was humbled in a lot of ways. In the last interview I talked in, I said in year 1 they threw at him a lot but recently they didn't and he didn't make the INTs and others' stat sheet shininers. The team record was also humbling. Always a humble person with a high level of confidence, at first was cocky but in year 3 leaving UNM, it was confidence. His biggest thing: maturity and handling adversity and his successes and passed up on the Senior Bowl and passed on the combine and added to the chip of his shoulder and he went to work harder instead of complaining he wasn't included. You're invited to those things because of your team's success and he was passed up because of his loyalty and who he is, but at the end of the day those are challenges, and all the things we talked about in-depth led to his maturity and when he left here he left a legacy in the safety room and the team as hard work, good human, always a phone call away and loyal. Maturity was the biggest thing, and the game grew a little every day personality and maturity night a day from when he met him 3 years ago.

**Summary:**Reed has grown a lot as he was humbled in a lot of ways. They threw the ball at him quite a bit in his first year. He continuously developed and by year 3 he had all the confidence in the world. He had maturity and was able to handle adversity, especially after being passed up on the senior bowl and the combine. This put a chip on his shoulder and made him work even more. He kept working and showed loyalty that by the time he left, he had a legacy in the safety room as a harder worker and a good human.

**ST**: Knowing Jerrick, what do you think being drafted in the later part of the NFL Draft means to his super aggressive personality?

**D**: Almost said it meant everything to him, but in reality, he knew he would've made it. His goal had been set and he didn't want to listen to all the naysayers that said he was too short, not long enough, not fast enough, converted corner, not physical enough, he's from UNM, all these different things put him in a box but he never stayed in the box. His confidence allowed him to stay in the tracks, but when he heard his name called by Seattle at the end of the 6th was a life changer and a kudos and a pat on the back and saying all these years and not listening to all that negative stuff and not allowing it to affect you not reacting out of emotion and staying on track and doing what you do is a good job well done and a pat on the back and kudos to his work ethic and everything he's been taught since being a little boy. Altogether it was not just the next step of his life, but more everything when he got the call, doesn't matter if he was picked 100 or pick 198 he just needed an opportunity and he and his family and #12 and making plays with Seattle was all sincere and excited to be a Seahawk.

**Summary:**In reality, he knew that he was going to make it. He set a goal, didn't listen to any of the naysayers that said he didn't have the attributes to make it in the NFL as a safety, and was able to get his name called by Seattle as a result. He didn't let any of the negativity affect him and make him act out of emotion and he stayed on track to his goal. It doesn't matter whether "it was pick 100 or pick 198", he just needed an opportunity to make plays with Seattle.

**ST**: One thing to help prepare him or someone joining to NFL as a piece of advice?

**D**: Its a business way more than college, don't let anything distract you keep doing what you've been doing, you need to do a lot in succession to make it to the NFL #1, but now that your there u need to educate urself what do with that money, how to spend/invest. The minute he signed the contract my wife said to investments and he thought maybe let's get a car but knowing Jerrick he will invest his money and protect his future. The question was about that level to take care of yourself, don't let the path change, and never stop thinking like a "GA" and that's something I always tell people when they move or a grad assistant always do extra things always do more always show up early and leave late always do what's necessary and stay humble and stay hungry. Once you made it find a another mountain to climb and that's the advice I would have for Jerrick: keep doing what Jerrick has always done and go embrace being #32. Once you get in think about specific teams then starting, then longevity, then Pro Bowl then family, and you have so many cool goals ahead of you don't change what you've done because that's all required for the future don't take your foot off the gas.

**Summary:**The NFL is a business, so don't let anything or anybody distract you from you've been doing. You've already done a lot just to get into the NFL, but now you need to educate yourself on what to do with the new money you've acquired. How to spend it safely and how to invest it. You also have to keep showing that dedication, that focus, by always hustling to do more and doing extra work. Keep working on that and shifting your goals after you achieve them (going from special teams to starting, then to longevity, then pro bowls, etc). Make sure that you don't take "your foot off the gas".
