The Seahawks after seeming dysfunctional on special teams, have gotten their form together and have returned to being beneficial for the Seahawks in clutch situations. Read below for individual position groups and their improvements over the season.

**Jason Myers**

Signed prior to the 2019 season, Myers played inconsistently in his Seahawks career, seemingly playing well every other year. In 2019, he was inconsistent as he only hit 82% of his field goals. He then had a stellar year in 2020, making every field goal and at the time, his highest XP percentage. In 2021, Myers regressed a bit, having a 73% field goal percentage (the second lowest of his career). This regression led to many questioning if Myers was worth the $5 million cap hit that came for the final year of his contract, the 2022 season. So far, Myers has silenced the doubters and has validated the trust of Pete Caroll and John Schnieder, as Myers has only missed one field goal and one extra point all year, allowing the Seahawks to win close games such as the Week 1 thriller vs the Broncos.

**Kick/Punt Return**

The Seahawks have routinely fielded one of the best special teams in the league for the past several years, first under Brian Schneider, and then under Larry Izzo. However, if there was one aspect of the Seahawks' special teams that has been underwhelming, it has to be the Seahawk's return game, which despite of several changes in returners over the past couple of seasons, has not yielded a good return (pun intended). So far this season, the Seahawks have experimented with both Deejay Dallas and Dee Eskridge for kick returns, but they have both rarely been able to make a large impact in the return game despite Eskridge being touted as a good returner out of college. In punt returning, the Seahawks experimented with Tyler Lockett returning punts as he once used to do as a rookie, but unfortunately, it did not go well. Lockett had a fumble and a muff on 2 of his punt coverages due to bad blocking by the Seahawks, allowing the opposing gunners to disrupt Lockett in the process of him fielding the punt. The Seahawks then let Dallas return punts, who has shown some flashes in the punt return game but has at times had head-scratching decisions while calling fair catches, calling them at times when he has had space in front of him to gain at least 5-10 extra yards.

**Michael Dickson**

After being drafted in the 4th round of the 2018 draft, Dickson has performed as one of the NFL's best punters. Potentially being snubbed of pro bowl selections in recent years, even though he has been classified as an elite punter, Dickson has shined for the Seahawks. However, early on in this year, he seemed to have continuous mistakes, whenever he was on the field. He hesitated while punting which allowed the opposing team to reach him, forcing a fumble, and putting the ball in the redzone. Another time he wasn't able to get the ball out in time, resulting in a blocked punt. While that may be blamed on protection during the punt, it is also the punter's job to get the ball out as fast and as far as possible. Since his mishaps, Dickson has been phenomenal, being able to punt the ball at any distance as fast as possible, with no punting or protection mishaps since those incidents.

The Seahawks had one of the strongest special teams over the last few years, and even though the entire unit has had a slow start to this season, in recent weeks they have warmed up, becoming one of the best special team units once again.
