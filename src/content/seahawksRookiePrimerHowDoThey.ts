    Today on Seahawks Today we will be looking at the incoming rookie class and examining their potential fits on the team, including UDFAs. Read below for a full breakdown on each player:



The #Seahawks drafted rookie contracts:  

**DT Byron Murphy \[OTC\]:**  

![](https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/4ea55b07-9374-42ca-9b6e-8e6262d9e995_2879x1621.jpeg)





Byron Murphy II was the Seahawks first round pick in the 2024 NFL Draft, and is an absolute monster in run defense as well as pass rush. While he hasn't fully developed as a pass rusher, he has demonstrated incredible power and strength, as he showcased the ability to play nose tackle at Texas despite being undersized for the position.

This unique versatility likely will allow him to play a reserve role and then work his way into the starting lineup as the season progresses. If it is confirmed that Dre'Mont Jones is playing EDGE full time next season, then we could see Murphy start day one as a 3-4 DE who at times can rotate and play nose tackle with Jarran Reed depending on Mike Macdonald's scheme.

Contract Details (4-years):

Total projected signing bonus: $8,516,816.

Haynes was the first major draft steal for the Seahawks, who were able to grab him in the third round while many publications and consensus rankings had him being at least a second round talent. While he is a little on the older side, he is a great athlete and with that, has great prowess especially in the run blocking department, showcasing great speed and power when moving side-to-side. He at times can struggle in pass-protection, especially with penalties and staying balanced in pass sets.

This likely slots him in as a day-one starter for the Seahawks at RG, with the potential to maul players in the Seahawks zone running scheme as he matures as a pass blocker.

**LB Tyrice Knight \[OTC\]:**

After picking up two players that were highly regarded relative to their draft position, the Seahawks broke the mold and took a gamble on linebacker Tyrice Knight from UTEP. Knight is a prototypical developmental linebacker, with great instincts, especially in the run game. He has high play speed and secures tackles well, but can often get caught on blocks in the run game. He also struggles with coverage responsibilities and can be fooled by concepts like play action.

Developmental players like Knight can be the hallmark of a great coach. If Macdonald truly is a "linebacker-guru" then he should help Knight unlock his potential after likely being the primary backup linebacker for 2024.

2024 Cap Hit Ratio: 0.38%

**TE A.J.Barner \[OTC\]:**  

![](https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/2c13b60c-5db7-4c5c-b474-020259bc3ebe_1200x702.jpeg)

AJ Barner out of Michigan was drafted by the Seahawks in the 4th round and plays as the typically Y-TE (in-line TE). This means that he has lots of experience when it comes to run-blocking and can serve as a safety target for the QB. Barner is great in this role, blocking with intensity and being able to box-out defenders for small receptions. However, he lacks elite athleticism or speed that would make him a top-tier TE in the league.

Barner pretty easily slots in as the Will Dissly replacement, as Barner has a very similar skillset. Look for Barner to be utilized in the short-passing game like Dissly was early in the season while totalling 10-15 snaps a game as TE3. After this season, it is likely for him to even jump to TE2 after the expiration of Pharaoh Brown's contract.   

4-years:  

Base Salary APY: $1,193,777

Cash Bonus: $1,550,108

Guaranteed salary: $755,108

2024 Cap Number: $983,777

2025 Cap Number: $1,148,777

2026 Cap Number: $1,263,777

2027 Cap Number: $1,378,777

2024 Cap Hit Ratio: 0.38%



**CB Nehemiah Pritchett \[OTC\]:**  

![](https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/e2cce67c-aa8f-4ea1-8f68-2f3e57078d86_1600x900.jpeg)

Another player that was regarded as a steal, Nehemiah Pritchett only seems to add to Seattle's impressive CB room. Pritchett is a very versatile player, who plays well in zone and man as a boundary corner. He is however, slightly undersized and this likely contributes to his poor tackling and run defense.

Pritchett would likely slot into the LCB competition while Woolen plays RCB and Witherspoon plays Nickel. This means that Pritchett would be directly competing with Michael Jackson and Tre Brown, both of whom flashed in the beginning and end of the 2023 season. If Pritchett isn't able to win the starting job this season, he will likely have another chance next year when Jackson and Brown's contracts both expire.   

4-years:  

Base Salary APY: $1,099,768

Cash Bonus: $1,174,072

Guaranteed salary: $379,072

2024 Cap Number: $889,768

2025 Cap Number: $1,054,768

2026 Cap Number: $1,169,768

2027 Cap Number: $1,284,768

2024 Cap Hit Ratio: 0.34%

**RT Sataoa Laumea \[OTC\]:**  

![](https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/e5521bb0-d1ce-44d7-add2-c08ebec62576_1200x630.jpeg)

Laumea was another developmental the Seahawks selected in the 6th round of the 2024 NFL Draft. While Laumea played tackle at Utah in college, he profiles to become a guard in the NFL. Laumea plays at a huge size, and has lots of experience using that size to move players in the run game. He still struggles from time-to-time in pass protection and leveraging his weight against the opposing rusher's.

Laumea will likely play a backup role for the 'Hawks in his first season. If he excels in training camp, he might be able to win one of the primary guard backup positions, likely from either Tremayne Anchrum or Laken Tomlinson. In a few years he could become an eventual starter if he continues to develop.

Contract Details:

Base Salary APY: $1,059,129

Cash Bonus: $1,011,516

Guaranteed salary: $216,516

2024 Cap Number: $849,129

2025 Cap Number: $1,014,129

2026 Cap Number: $1,129,129

2027 Cap Number: $1,244,129

2024 Cap Hit Ratio: 0.33%

**CB D.J. James \[OTC\]:**  

![](https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/99f51d28-05a9-46bd-a054-53495b670a68_3800x2000.jpeg)

DJ James was another 6th-round pick from the Seahawks, and likely profiles as a speedy nickel corner in the NFL. He has great athleticism and short-area-quickness that is essential near the LOS. He also is an aggressive tackler, but sometimes his size can lead to him getting bulled by bigger receivers or ball-carriers.

James likely slots in as the primary backup Nickel to Witherspoon. We saw last season that when Witherspoon was injured, there was no real backup plan in place for the secondary. James would help alleviate that need. While he will probably not become the starter at nickel as long as Witherspoon starts there, he could have upside as a 6th defensive back in dime packages.

Guaranteed salary: $184,432

2024 Cap Number: $841,108

2025 Cap Number: $1,006,108

2026 Cap Number: $1,121,108

2027 Cap Number: $1,236,108

2024 Cap Hit Ratio: 0.32%

**T Mike Jerrell:**  

![](https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/fd51304b-c5c7-4607-a537-9fead66bbb9c_2000x1125.jpeg)

Michael Jerrell was the Seahawks final selection in the 2024 draft, and one of the only players to be selected from a D2 school. Jerrell has incredible athleticism and size for his position, which gives him a unique explosiveness in space. However, it might be tough for him to adjust to NFL-caliber pass rushers and his blocking techniques could overall use some work.

Jerrell was seen earlier in Seahawks training camp playing at Guard as well as tackle. This could likely mean that Jerrell would play a versatile G/T role that is absent currently on the roster. If he plays well, he could become the secondary tackle backup replacing Stone Forsythe this season. If he still takes time to develop, he could get another shot next season, when Forsythe's contract expires.

Undrafted #Seahawks rookies: All of these contracts will be contingent on if they make the team. If they don't, they will be given their guaranteed money.

**IDL Budda Jones, IDL Nathan Pickering and LB Devin Richardson:**

Buddha Jones is an intriguing prospect for a Seahawks IDL that has yet to shape out its depth pieces. Jones will be competing with the likes of Myles Adams, and Nathan Pickering for a roster spot.



Nathan Pickering will also compete for the last few IDL spots behind clear starters Murphy, Williams, and Jones, but also behind backups Mike Morris and Cam Young. Likely only one of Pickering or Jones will be on the final 53 man roster.

Devin Richardson provides quality depth at one of the weakest spots on the Seahawks roster with huge turnover from last year. Richardson will likely compete with Patrick O'Connell, Drake Thomas, and Jon Rhattigan for the 3rd ILB on the roster behind Tyrel Dodson and Jerome Baker.

**CB Ro Torrence \[OTC/Spotrac\]:**

Ro Terrance has a somewhat lacking physical profile that hurt him in the draft process. He will likely be fighting to maintain a roster spot throughout preseason, but due to Seattle's high CB depth, it will be tough for Torrence to even make the practice squad.  

3-years:

**C Mike Novitsky \[Spotrac\]:**

The Seahawks currently only have two other active centers on the roster, presumed starter Olu Oluwatimi and G/C Nick Harris. This may give Novitsky, who has experience playing all across the line, a practice squad spot in case of extreme injury like in 2023.

**IDL Devere Levelston and EDGE Rason Williams \[Spotrac\]:**

Devere Levelston has the flexibility to play edge, similar to Dre'Mont Jones. This flexibility may make him a valuable commodity in Mike Macdonald's scheme to the point where he could make the practice squad, but it is a long shot due to the DL depth present.

Rason Williams is likely to profile as a 3-tech lineman, which could mean he slides in behind Leonard Williams and Byron Murphy on the depth chart. Like Levelston, it will be tough to make the team as he competes with players like Myles Adams and Cameron Young.

**CB Carlton Johnson \[Spotrac\]:**

Carlton Johnson is one of the Seahawks UDFA's steals, as he's a speedster that ram an unofficial 4.28 40-yard dash. He was a top-30 visit for the Seahawks prior to the Draft and I think could have a chance to crack the back of the depth chart or practice squad, competing against players like Artie Burns and the other UDFAs.

**RB Kobe Lewis \[Spotrac\]:**

Kobe Lewis is another prospect that could be added to an already stacked RB group with K9, Charbonnet, and Kenny McIntosh. Since the Seahawks did not draft any other running backs in their 2024 draft, it is plausible that a player like Lewis could make the practice squad and even play snaps near the end of the season.

(Lewis finished his college career with Florida Atlantic)

**RB TaMerik Williams \[Spotrac\]:**Williams is a likely backup to the 3rd-down role, as he has good blocking skills that could be useful if there are significant injuries to the RB core. As we mentioned before, a spot on the practice squad could be plausible if he can beat out the rest of the UDFA RBs.

**EDGE Sundiata Anderson and EDGE Nelson Ceaser \[Spotrac\]:**

Sundiata Anderson out of Grambling State is a powerful edge rusher that can contribute in the run defense for the Seahawks. With news that Dre'Mont Jones may be playing more EDGE in 2024, then Anderson could get signed to a practice squad deal and slowly work his way up into the EDGE rotation.

Caesar is another versatile, fast edge rusher who has experience playing 3-4 OLB and also playing ILB, primarily blitzing. This gives him an increased chance to make the practice squad due to the lack of depth at linebacker and edge.

**RB George Holani \[Spotrac\]:**

Holani is a RB prospect that many thought would go on Day 3 of the NFL Draft. Holani is more of an elusive style back that has a similar skillset to K9. He also flashes a unique pass-catching talent that could be useful for the Seahawks if injuries come. 3-years:

**WR Hayden Hatten \[Spotrac\]:**

Hatten is a playmaker, who is best with the ball in his hands, but not great at creating separation or in run-blocking. THis would make him a unique gadget type of player like how the Seahawks tried to use Dee Eskridge and a Jake Bobo (a little bit) last year. If there is a need for this type of player in Ryan Grubb's offense, the Seahawks may offer him a spot on the PS3-years:

**LT Garret Greenfield \[Spotrac\]:**

Greenfield has the flexibility to play both LT and RT and is a good downfield blocker. This could be an intriguing prospect for the SEahawks to use as an additional lineman in goal-line sets or just to roster on the PS in case of injury to Cross, Lucas, or Fant.

**LB Easton Gibbs \[Spotrac\]:**

Easton Gibbs is a great tackler who can wrap up, but at times lacks the athleticism and power needed to shed blocks and fulfill coverage assignments, especially in the NFL. If Gibbs can make the team, they will likely use him as a backup option on the PS to players like John Rhattigan and Patrick O'Connell.

**TE Jack Westover \[Spotrac\]:**

A fan favorite, Westover was an underrated cog in the high-flying UW offense that reached the national championship. Westover was key to getting chunk gains that helped moved the chains - very similar to what Will Dissly did last year. Westover could receive a PS spot to be used as a 4th TE in case of injury to Barner or Pharaoh. 3-years:

**WR Dee Williams \[Spotrac\]:**

While a receiver, Williams main role on the Volunteers was being a great punt returner, which would be critical for the Seahawks that don't have a clear #1 punt returner. He will likely compete with players like Laviska Shenault and Dee Eskridge for these special teams snaps.
