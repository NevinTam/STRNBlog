Hi! This is a draft post. Did you know that there are a bunch of nice formatting options in this editor? For example:
> Block quotes are a nice way to put a quote or excerpt from a source. They make it clear that it is a quote.

Of course, you can also do **bold,** *italic* , [links](https://www.substack.com),and all that good stuff.

### Headings and Embeddings

You can have headings in posts. Just use the "Style"list in the toolbar. You can also embed different types of content. To add an image, just drag it in here or use the image selector tool in the toolbar.

For a tweet, YouTube video, Vimeo video, Spotify track, or SoundCloud embed, just paste the relevant link on a new line (don't grab the embed code; it won't work).

To delete a post, click on the **Settings** button (just to the left of Publish), and scroll down and find the delete button.

#### Publishing Changes

You have two publishing options:

1. **Publish** -- this publishes your post only to the web.

2. **Publish \& Send** -- this publishes your post to the web and at the same time sends the post out by email.

Note: Once you have sent an email out, the only way to send it again is to create an entirely new post. Any edits you make to a post that has already been published will only be reflected on the web. So, there's no need to worry about accidentally spamming your subscribers with repeat emails.

Finally, if you import posts from some other site's archives, you can backdate them so they are published in the correct order and associated with the correct publication dates. To do so, after you have published a post, go into that post's Settings (just to the left of the Publish button) and select the desired date.
