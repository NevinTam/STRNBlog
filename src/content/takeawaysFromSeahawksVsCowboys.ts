**Offensive Takeaways**

The Seahawks lost, but they played a hell of a game on offense. Up until the last few drives, they played nearly perfect thanks to huge games thanks to huge games from DK Metcalf and Geno Smith. While the pass blocking wasn't great, Geno was able to find the open receiver with blistering speed and convert crucial third downs. In many tight situations, the Seahawks were able to convert 3rd downs using YAC, especially a few clutch receptions from JSN. JSN had a huge game and was very close to a TD on a pass that drew DPI anyway. DK Metcalf had 3 touchdowns and torched DPOY candidate Daron Bland for most of the first half. While Bland had a pick in the second half, he still didn't affect the Seahawks as much as he has other teams. This game was a prime example of Geno Smith putting the team on his back and delivering an elite game. It was very reminiscent of last season's game against the Saints, where Geno looked simply sensational. If the Seahawks are to make a late-season push for the playoffs, they will need a huge stretch from Geno Smith.

**Defensive Breakdown**

The Seahawks Defense, on the other hand, played one of their worst performances of the Pete Caroll era. They had no answers for the onslaught of the Cowboys aerial attack. CeeDee Lamb especially had an incredible game burning Seahawks DBs all game. Witherspoon had one of his worst games of the season, and Woolen, while technically sound in coverage, gave up a huge amount of yardage in the form of penalties. Penalties were the story all game for both teams, and the Seahawks continued to show their lack of discipline with tons of penalties, especially in the secondary. The Seahawks linebackers were also targeted in coverage often in this game, especially after LB Jordyn Brooks left the game with an injury early. The Seahawks pass rush, while recording 4 sacks, was not able to rack up much pressure on Prescott as the game wore on, letting him pick apart the defense. The Seahawks will ahve to play better next game as they face an elite pass-catching group with George Kittle, CMC, Brandon Aiyuk, and Deebo Samuel.
