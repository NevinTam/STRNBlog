There are 3 main components of a football team. The offense, the defense, and the special teams. To win you usually need at least 2 of these groups working cohesively. While the Seahawks won, it was not pretty, except for the offense, which looked unstoppable omitting drive-killing penalties. In this recapitulation, I will talk about all 3 components, which ones need to be praised, and which need immense focus (defense).

**1. Special Teams Inconveniences**

Probably the least concerning part of the Seahawks, the special teams have had mental errors that have cost them quite a bit. Tyler Lockett, an All-Pro returner in his rookie year, has not returned kicks or punts consistently since his accolade 6+ years ago. 2 of the last 3 weeks have resulted in Tyler Lockett being unable to come down with the ball, whether it be due to a fumble or someone else running into him. Both these mishaps caused the opposing offense to get into redzone territory and score, with total momentum. The Seahawks' return game also has been anything but electric, putting the Seahawks in average at best positions when going on offense. If the Seahawks want to continue their monster offensive numbers against actually formidable defenses they will need all the help they can get, especially from their special teams.

**2. Offensive Legendary Outing**

Geno Smith should have been the quarterback that the Denver Broncos traded for. Smith has led the NFL in completion percentage through the first quarter of the 2022 season. In fact, Smith has made history again, having the highest completion percentage ever at 77.3%, through the first four weeks of any season in the history of the NFL. Comparing the 2021 Seahawks' offense with Wilson vs the 2022 one with Geno, this year's team bests Wilson in points scored, total yards, and passing yards. Russell Wilson was known for avoiding the middle of the field when passing, but Geno having the skill to do so has allowed Waldron to open up the playbook and counteract anything the defense throws at them. Wilson very badly wanted to escape to the Broncos because he wanted to win, but both teams have the same record and Geno has a higher completion percentage, higher passer rating, more scrimmage yards, more YPA, more touchdowns, and fewer sacks taken. The only statistic Wilson beats out Geno is in interceptions, with Geno having 2 compared to Wilson's 1. Geno Smith was the main reason why the Seahawks one against the Detroit Lions, but he was not the only factor.

As aforementioned Geno Smith was the biggest factor in the Seahawks' success, but definitely not the only one. Enter Rashaad Penny, who statistically had the best week with 151 yards on the ground. That was not all volume-based however, as Penny has the highest yards per carry at 8.9 for any running back with above 14 carries. Including all running backs regardless of carries, Penny ranked second with 17 carries for 8.9 ypc compared to Dameon Pierce's 14 attempts for 9.4 yards per carry. Rashaad Penny was the more elite running back in the last stretch for the 2021 season, but clearly showed with enough volume he can repeat that performance and be the running back the Seahawks always drafted him to be. This was not even considering Kenneth Walker III, the 2nd round rookie out of Michigan, who put up 8 carries for 29 yards, for a respectable 3.6 yards per carry with limited volume. At first glance, this may seem ordinary, but knowing many of his carries were on 3rd and short situations that required him to go against loaded fronts, that makes his production much more interesting knowing what each of his individual yards meant.

**3. Defense Staggeringly Miserable**

Looking at the box score this was very clearly a battle of the offenses, with only one punt being forced this game, which was by the Seahawks early in the first quarter. After that, almost everything went straight downhill. The Seahawks while able to force two turnovers, were not able to get much pressure on an injured offensive line. It seems the two basic principles of Hurtt's defenses, to create turnovers and get pressure consistently, cannot be followed at the same time as either one is followed or neither are. For the first few weeks the Seahawks were able to get some, perhaps inconsistent, pressure, but this week the two rookie corners each created a turnover, one being a fumble forced by Coby Bryant and the other being a pick-6 by Tariq Woolen on the opening play of the second half. While the defense not getting any pressure was a problem, it was still not the biggest problem with the defense overall.

Enter the run defense, a unit getting shredded by Jamaal Williams and Cordarrelle Patterson. Patterson entering his ninth season in the NFL set a career-high in rush yards against the Seahawks during week 3. Jamaal Williams, a delegated backup for the Lions who started once Swift was designated out with injury, ran over the Seahawks' defense for 108 yards on 19 carries. He was able to get more than half a first down, or 5.7 yards per carry every time he was running, which is unacceptable for a defense with 2 middle linebackers on almost every play. To top it off he was able to get in the endzone not once, but TWICE. For reference, D'Andre Swift the clear starter when healthy could only get in the redzone once in 3 weeks against average to above average run defenses. Again, this is only the SECOND biggest problem for the Seahawks on defense.

To start off, there is loads of talent on this defense, especially high potential-filled players in the secondary, but man we cannot stop the pass. Similarly to how we gave Cordarrele Patterson his career high in rushing yards, we also gave TJ Hockenson his career high in receiving yards. This is a team that has two middle linebackers that both struggle in pass coverage, but the more astonishing fact is Cody Barton, who was a former safety but still struggles in coverage. We have a middling secondary but the linebackers are a clear weakness in run defense and pass defense, but mainly the latter this season. Brooks had allowed a whopping 253 yards in pass coverage while Barton has allowed 146. The secondary is without Jamal Adams and has rookie corners who are still learning the fundamentals of the game. Jordyn Brooks is a first-round pick who learned from Bobby Wagner and KJ Wright, while Cody Barton studied from the same people but from the bench. Brooks and Barton are entering their third and fourth year, respectively. They have no excuse based on their experience and mentors to be horrific.

Jamal Adams' replacement was supposed to be Josh Jones, but Jones has missed more than one of every four tackles he attempts. He has singlehandedly allowed offenses to carry on with their drives because he chooses to fly at the runner, avoiding all contact with them, falling to the ground while others must scurry to help their team. Jones also is not able to fill the role of Jamal in his hybrid blitzer-safety position and thus the defense has needed to "change gears" and rework their game plan without a fundamental part. Ryan Neal has played admirable in the past in wake of Jamal's continuous absences and has shown he is able to tackle so a change of 2nd string safety may be in place. Josh Jones has been one of the Seahawks' many problems but without rapid development, he may be better suited as a rotational piece, similar to the one Neal has played for many years.

The Seahawks need to adhere to the many problems they had over the course of the season, but also need to learn how to repeat the large successes they had, mainly on offense, for week 5 against the New Orleans Saints.
