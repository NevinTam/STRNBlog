After years of speculation, buzzing rumours, and hours of podcast chatter, the Seahawks have finally done it. They traded star WR DK Metcalf.

To the Seahawks, Metcalf was much more than simply a great WR. Even beyond the huge games and jaw-dropping plays, DK was a national icon for the Seahawks. If you asked any NFL fan about the Seahawks, the first thought in their mind would be Metcalf. He would routinely pop up in NFL highlights and represent some of the brightest points that the Seahawks had in the Pete Caroll post-LOB era. Now the final Seahawk of the 2019 draft is on his way to Pittsburgh hot off signing a 4-year, $132 million extension.

However, this trade along with the recent Geno Smith trade, signals a change of times as the Seahawks trade away one of the last few players tied extensively with the Pete Caroll era. For a team seeking to establish itself and its identity under new HC Mike Macdonald, they’ve taken an approach to almost rebuilding their offensive game plan ahead of free agency.  When OC Klint Kubiak was hired, few (and likely not even Kubiak himself) thought that these kinds of sweeping changes would come to Seattle. It’s possible that even GM John Schneider himself didn’t expect such drastic trade requests to come right before FA, as just days before at the combine Schneider reiterated his plan to compete with Geno and DK at the helm. 

Regardless of the reasons behind this personnel and ideological shift, It’d be best to remind fans that the Seahawks have always had intent behind their seasons. In Schneider’s 15 year tenure the Seahawks have never attempted to “tear-it-down” or “rebuild”. Not after the LOB-exit in 2017/2018. Not after trading franchise QB Russell Wilson in 2022. The Seahawks have always made moves that they believed put them further towards contention. While one may question the intuition behind swapping Geno Smith for a Sam Darnold or Aaron Rodgers, you best believe that the Seahawks are gearing up to make a run in any way they can in 2025. They’ve already taken notable “win-now” moves to get there, with the recent signing of Jarran Reed and recent restructure of Leonard Williams contract. Now armed with over $68 million dollars in cap space and 5 top 100 picks (receiving number 52 in DK trade), we’ll watch as the free agency negotiating period begins and see how Schneider utilizes his arsenal in 2025.

With almost every Seahawks mainstay of the Pete Carroll Seahawks gone, this will be a chance to see what a real “Mike Macdonald” team looks like, on both sides of the ball. After continuous QB rumours regarding John Schneider, we’ll finally see what his ideal QB and offense is. With a hot seat to fill and a clean slate, Schneider will have his hands full managing what might be his most important offseason yet.
