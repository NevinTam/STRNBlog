Another week of football in the books, and another Seahawks loss. You might be hearing a lot of that over the course of the season. But if you're an optimist, like I am on most days, you'll see that the Broncos are also struggling. If the Broncos don't end up living up to expectations this season, the draft picks the Seahawks acquired from them in the \*bleep\* trade will be even higher in value and position. So today we will be looking at some prospects the Seahawks could look to with those acquired picks.

Jordan Addison - WR - USC

Projection: Taken with the Broncos 1st round pick

Now some of you may think that the receiver is the least of our worries, but hear me out. Tyler Lockett's contract hit increases from 10 million to 16 million over the next year and then increases to 24 million in 2024. The Seahawks are a rebuilding team and veteran receiver money is money they can't afford to keep, even if it is a beloved player like Lockett. The Hawks already lack a strong WR3, and if the Broncos lose enough games to get their(our) first-round pick within the top 15 picks, Addison could be a real possibility. The former Biletnikoff winner is a smooth route runner who also possesses deep speed and can work outside or in the slot. The Seahawks need what Addison brings to the table, especially if they want to help out a possible rookie QB.

John Michael-Schmitz - IOL - Minnesota

Projected: Taken with the Broncos 2nd round pick

While the Seahawks tackles have been the object of showering praise over the first 3 weeks, the interior has been the subject of many 12's criticisms. Damien Lewis had 2 killer penalties against the Falcons, and Gabe Jackson doesn't look serviceable overall. But if you were watching the Gophers on Saturday, you would see an O-line that had their way with the opposing defensive line. That line is led by senior John Michael-Schmitz. Playing at the center, Schmitz allowed 0 pressures over 31 pass-blocking snaps and paved the way for Mohamed Ibrahim (mentioned in last week's article) to carry the ball 22 times for 103 yards and a TD. Even though Schmitz has very little experience playing outside of the center, I think he has the size to be moved to guard for the Hawks.

Nick Hampton - EDGE - Appalachian State

Projected: Taken with the Broncos 2nd round pick

Another position of woes for the Hawks has surprisingly been EDGE. Coming into the season many 12s anticipated the combo of Uchenna Nwosu, Darrell Taylor, and Boye Mafe to finally give the Seahawks the strong edge presence that they have lacked since trading Frank Clark. However the group has not only failed to produce sacks, having only 3 combined through 3 weeks, but they have also failed to consistently set the edge in the run game. Nick Hampton is a more unknown name among draft fans, but I promise his tape does not disappoint. He has all the makings of an elite pass rusher with great burst, size, and length. The thing that he would have to work on in the NFL is developing his pass rush moves to consistently beat NFL tackles.

Trenton Simpson - ILB - Clemson

Projection: Taken with the Broncos 1st round pick

Simpson is undoubtedly the most exciting prospect on this list. The Seahawks have an evident weakness at linebacker when it comes to pass coverage, and Simpson is just the piece they need. The Clemson Tiger brings elite athleticism and enticing versatility. He is able to cover up slot receivers, come down against the run, and be an effective pass rusher. Him pairing up with Jordan Brooks will hopefully give the Seahawks the formula to plug the run and better cover the pass.

As with the Seahawk's native picks, I would very much like to talk about Will Levis and why the Seahawks should draft him. I will wait until he plays through part of Wildcat's SEC schedule so I can give a more detailed profile of the mayo-coffee drinker. Will Anderson Jr is also a popular name among Seahawks fans to be taken with our first pick, but I will also wait till the end of the college season to see how he pans out. But that will be it for today's draft article. Enjoy this weekend's College Football, and Go Hawks!
