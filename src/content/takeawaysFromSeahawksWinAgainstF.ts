**Pass Rush**   
After a dominant performance against Andy Dalton and the Panther's offensive line, the Seahawks pass rush topped that performance with a Monday Night Football record 11 sacks! Seattle doubled their first three weeks of production and then plus, feasting on a completely overpowered Giants offense. The team had four different players record 2 sacks: All-Pro LB Bobby Wagner, EDGE Uchenna Nwosu, LB Jordyn Brooks, and, most surprisingly, rookie CB Devon Witherspoon. The performance didn't end there, however, as veteran Mario Edwards, former UDFA Myles Adams, and breakout player Boye Mafe each snagged one on the night. Seattle did not just have a high amount of sacks with limited pressures, though, as they had 25 pressures, more than their previous three weeks combined. Jamal Adams even recorded a single pressure in the 9 snaps he played on the first defensive drive of the game. One can only imagine the sack total if Jamal Adams was healthy the entire game. While the Giants did have a very injured offensive line, that is not an excuse for the high sack total they allowed, as the Seahawks had backups at every position across the offensive line and did not allow 11 sacks. This performance was generational and one for the history books in countless different ways.

**Devon Witherspoon**

Devon Witherspoon may have a good chance of being the Defensive Rookie of the Year after this historical performance. Not Jalen Carter, not Will Anderson Jr., not Nolan Smith but at the time of this game, Devon Witherspoon led all rookies in sacks as a cornerback. Coupled with his strong coverage that may have propelled him into the top 3 for DROY voting, but he added to his resume with another profounding play. Witherspoon recorded a 97-yard interception and took it to the house for a TD. For reference, this catapulted Witherspoon to the history charts, making him the first Defensive Back to record 2 sacks and an interception in a singular game. Going into this game people may have expected him to struggle with being forced from outside CB to the slot due to injury, however, that was not the case in the slightest. Witherspoon was everywhere on the field at once, bringing an emphasis of "swagger" that has not been fielded for the Seahawks in many years. Jamal Adams and Witherspoon have the ability to make this Seahawks defense one of the greats, purely by not being afraid to tackle opponents hard and their elite play. Witherspoon could easily be the Defensive Rookie of the Year after Seattle missed out on both rookies of the years last year.

**Offensive Consistency**

While the offense didn't play great against the Giants, they didn't need to. They were able to score when they got opportunities from the defense from turnovers. A huge issue through this game was the injuries all across the board, from along the offensive line, to DK Metcalf with a ribs issue, and even to Geno Smith who had to exit the game on an ankle injury. The offensive line didn't have a single starter in their assumed positions, as Evan Brown actually rotated to LG, and Olu Oluwatimi replaced him at C, with Anthony Bradford at RG. While the Seahawks still took sacks, they played well against a tough Giants defensive line for the most part. They were also able to clear rushing lanes for Zach Charbonnet and Kenneth Walker as the game wore on, allowing them to bust big runs to get the Seahawks into field goal range. Even when Geno Smith was out of the game, Drew Lock was able to go into the game and convert a key 3rd-down before completing a 50-yard YAC completion to Noah Fant before finishing the TD drive off with a handoff to Kenneth Walker.
