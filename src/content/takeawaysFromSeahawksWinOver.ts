    The Seahawks on Monday stunned the Denver Broncos, upsetting them 17-16 in an ugly game from both sides. We learned some key takeaways from this game for the Seahawks that may be key signs of what we might see for the rest of the season.

**1. Increased Tight End Usage**

Geno Smith during post-game interview mentioned how the Seahawks intended to incorporate more TEs in the game plan due to a weaker Denver linebacking corps. This game plan succeeded, as both Seahawks' touchdowns and half their passing yardage came via the tight end position. Will Dissly and Colby Parkinson had great games specifically, Dissly scoring on a wide-open TD on the opening offensive possession and Parkinson beating Broncos LB Jonas Griffith up the seam for the touchdown. The best part? Noah Fant didn't even get going this game, making us truly wonder what he has along with the rest of the TEs.

**2. Rookie OT Performance**

Charles Cross and Abraham Lucas were the starting offensive tackles for only the third time in the last 50 years since the merger. Their performance was good against a defensive line starting Randy Gregory and Bradley Chubb at both edge positions. While Cross did give up 2 sacks in the 4th, he did well up till then. Abraham Lucas played with a strong intensity during the game, limiting Randy Gregory and being a force in the run game. Lucas did have one key (questionable) holding penalty on a big Penny run but otherwise was good in the run game.

**3. Seahawks Run Defense**

The Seahawks' run defense - exceptional for the past 2 seasons - was slow to start the game, giving over 7 yards per carry in the first half. However, the Seahawks clamped down on the run in the 2nd half, only allowing 3.6 YPC to RBs Javonte Williams and Melvin Gordon. Such a difference could be attributed to the shift into a more 3-4 defense and new acquisitions along the defensive line. Another big reason for the change in the Seahawks' run defense could be the loss of LB Bobby Wagner. Wagner was declining in pass coverage last season but was still efficient in run defense, allowing the Seahawks to be top 5 in run defense last year. The significant change from the first half to the second may signal defensive adjustments done at halftime that may carry to next week, but we must see more until we make a clear judgment on Seattle's run defense this year.

**4. Mixed Return on Seahawks Rookie CBs Coby Bryant and Tariq Woolen**

There was some good and some bad for the Seahawks' rookie CB duo in Coby Bryant and Tariq Woolen. Bryant only played a handful of snaps and after giving up a long touchdown to Jerry Jeudy, was benched for the rest of the game. Woolen, on the other hand, was targeted 3 times and gave up 0 completions, but drew 2 pass interference calls. The first of which was more of a controversial call and the second one (while saving a touchdown) was a clear PI. In the run game, Woolen was solid in the run game as well, an example of which was when Woolen tackled RB Javonte Williams after shedding the WR's block while the RB got the end around.

**5. Goodwin Established WR3**

One thing that was established during week one was the fact that Marquise Goodwin had taken over the WR3 role over Dee Eskridge. Goodwin played 28 snaps to only Ekridge's 5. Eskridge had suffered from some injuries during training camp and various injuries last year as well, which all hindered him from fully spending time with the team and learning the playbook. OC Shane Waldron confirmed this, mentioning that Goodwin has won the WR3 spot but Eskridge was close behind due to injury.



Overall the Seahawks had a game full of ups and downs against the Broncos, and revealed some key trends about this year's Seahawks. We'll have to see which of these takeaways will hold true next week against the 49ers, who have some key differences compared to the Broncos, causing a different gameplan to be executed.
