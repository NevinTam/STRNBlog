**Tariq Woolen and Coby Bryant vs Davante Adams**

After being traded to the Las Vegas Raiders, Davante Adams is having a stellar season. He has performed well in the slot and on the outside, hence Coby Bryant and Tariq Woolen are both listed as Adam's matchup. Adams has accumulated 925 receiving yards and a whopping 10 touchdowns. That is an average of 93 yards and a touchdown per game. Woolen and Bryant had allowed on average 83 yards and less than a touchdown per game. One side of the ball has to break, but knowing that one side has 2 rookies while the other has the best WR in the NFL, we can conclude that Woolen and Bryant will have a tough time covering Adams. Expect potential double teams on Adams to limit the Raider's best passing weapon.

**Seahawks EDGEs vs Kolton Miller and Jermaine Eluemunor**

Before we start, I want to point out that Kolton Miller, the Radier's best offensive lineman, is questionable for the game, so the Seahawks' EDGE's jobs may get even easier. Miller is a strong left tackle, having only allowed 3 sacks on 577 snaps. Whoever is on Miller may have a challenge, however, enter Jermaine Eluemunor, the Raiders' starting right tackle. The 27-year-old, while having only allowed 2 sacks on the season, has also been called for 6 penalties. While Eluemunor has not been bad, Miller is the better pass blocker. Uchenna Nwosu, Darrell Taylor, Bruce Irvin, and Boye Mafe have combined averaged around 4 pressures a game and slightly more than 1 sack per outing. With a mediocre offensive right tackle and an above-average left tackle, expect the Seahawks' edges to be able to beat their average of 4 pressures and 1 sack per game against the Raiders at home.

**Abraham Lucas and Charles Cross vs Chandler Jones and Maxx Crosby**

A year ago this may have been one most feared pass-rush duos in the league. Now it looks to be one of the saddest pass-rushing fronts in the league. For reference, Maxx Crosby makes up 9 of the Raiders' 13 sacks. Chandler Jones, the prized free agency buy, would be expected to have at least 2 or 3 of the remaining 4, but you would be extremely wrong. The $52 million dollar pass rush has cumulated an entire half of a sack. In other words, Jones has been nothing like what he was on the Cardinals, and Crosby is this team's only viable EDGE or pass rusher. However, while Jones has not been able to take down opposing quarterbacks, he has still recorded 10 pressures on the season, but still not just worthy of his contract. Lucas and Cross have outperformed preseason expectations, proving themselves to be one of the NFL's top tackle duos. You can expect Cross to be able to handle Jones relatively easily, but Crosby may be a challenge, however, Lucas has performed better than Cross in pass protection and may play better than expected, but it wouldn't be terrible to have a tight end block with Lucas.

**Seahawks' Front 7 vs Josh Jacobs**

Josh McDaniels joined the Raiders and immediately declined all 3 of their 2019 first-round-picks 5th-year option. For Jonathan Abram that seemed to be a good choice as he has been waived. For Clelin Ferrell it also has been a good choice as the former 4th overall pick has amassed 0.5 sacks so far this season. For the last player, Josh Jacobs, it was a complete mistake to not pick up his 5th year. Jacobs has been an absolute workhorse for the team, literally carrying the offense on his back. The second running back on the depth chart has 8 total carries, just showing how much Jacobs means to this offense. Jacobs has 1181 scrimmage yards and is on track for more than 2000 total yards this season. Expect the Raiders to either run with Jacobs or pass to Adams, nothing else. He is averaging a whopping 5.1 yards per carry and in the last 7 games has recorded 7 touchdowns. The Seahawks' front has played phenomenally since a terrible performance against the New Orleans Saints, except for their game against the Buccaneers, in which they allowed 4.5 yards per carry. While that number may seem high, the Buccaneers have been held to under 4 yards a carry for many plays but were able to pull away with long runs that helped put an end to the Seahawks' win streak. With an extra week of preparation, the Seahawks should be able to beat the opposing offensive line at the trenches and have their linebackers man up to make sure Jacobs doesn't run all over them. To stop Jacobs before he breaks away the Seahawks must set the tone at the line of scrimmage early on, and set the line of scrimmage back consistently. The Seahawks' front is currently fully healthy, while Jacobs is questionable with a hamstring injury.

**DK Metcalf and Tyler Lockett vs Rock Ya-Sin and Amik Robertson**

Entering this game the Raiders are one of the worst teams in yards allowed to opposing wide receivers. That makes Metcalf and Lockett, one of the league's best 1-2 punch happy. Rock Ya-Sin was traded early in the offseason from the Colts to the Raiders in a trade that also moved Yannick Ngakoue to Indy. Ya-Sin has allowed 314 yards in coverage and 9.2 yards per reception. Metcalf has obtained 12.1 yards per catch while Lockett at 11.9, respectively. As said earlier, either Metcalf and Lockett's average will break, or Ya-Sin's will, but most likely Ya-Sin will not be able to hold his ground. Amik Robertson, the 4th-round pick from the 2020 draft, has struggled this year, allowing a 78% completion percentage, along with 329 yards for 10.3 yards per catch. I expect 5'8 Robertson to be beaten constantly by 5'1 Lockett, while 6'0 Ya-Sin to be on Metcalf. The Seahawks' WRs are clearly the favored matchup this game and are expected to have a strong outing against one of the league's worst pass defenses.
