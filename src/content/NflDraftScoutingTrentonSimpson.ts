**Future Hawk? Clemson LB Trenton Simpson's scouting report**  
Thanks for reading SeahawksToday! Subscribe for free to receive new posts and support my work.  

As you probably saw in the title, today's article will be my first draft profile of the 2023 NFL draft season. I don't want to hear anyone saying it's too early to be talking about draft prospects, because frankly, every season is draft season for the NFL scouts working the field as well as myself. I will be doing players by popular demand, so join the Seahawks Today discord (https://discord.gg/mxD7ghkP2J) or give us a shout on Twitter (https://twitter.com/TodaySeahawks) to let us know who you want to see next. Now let's get to today's profile.

When Bobby Wagner was unexpectedly cut last spring, many Seahawks fans expected the team to select a linebacker in the draft to complement Jordan Brooks. But to the surprise of many, the Hawks stuck with Cody Barton. Barton has seen his average snap count decrease since the loss to New Orleans, and his overall play has been average at best. The Seahawks' best bet is to draft a pass coverage linebacker that compliments Jordyn Brook's prowess in defending the run. Trenton Simpson fits that role perfectly. As you'll see in my scouting report, Simpson has the skills and athleticism to cover all the dangerous slot weapons around the NFL.

Strengths:

-Shows a very high motor in pursuit

-Explosive off the snap. Short-area burst allows him to cover in the slot

-Stays patient in the run game; tracking the runner and sorting through blocks to make the play

-Shows fluid hip transitions in coverage

Shortcomings:

-In zone coverage, he has to get more depth to avoid leaving pockets of space

-He can be more consistent in getting off blocks

-Needs to be more physical when engaging blocks in the run game

Summary:

Among the Clemson defensive draft prospects in 2023, LB Trent Simpson may be the most intriguing one. His athleticism and versatility are things teams will be looking for in a modern-day linebacker. Simpson is a rangy player who is able to cover out in space in the passing game whether it be in man or zone coverage while also possessing the ability to be dangerous on blitzes with his closing speed. He shows great instincts in coverage as well as good overall awareness of the field. However, Simpson does have a ways to go in terms of refining his game. He can improve as a zone defender as well as his overall run defense game. But with the traits Trenton Simpson has, it will be hard for an LB-needy team to pass him up in the first round.

**Numerical Grade: 85.5/100**

**Projection: Floor - Serviceable Starterer -----\> Ceiling - All Pro Caliber**

**Round Grade: Top 15**
