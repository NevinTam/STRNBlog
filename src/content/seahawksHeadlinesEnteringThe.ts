**IOL Damien Lewis, Evan Brown, and Phil Haynes vs. DT Aaron Donald**

The Seahawks' interior offensive line consists of Damien Lewis, Evan Brown, and Phil Haynes. Both Brown and Haynes are new full-time starters for the Seahawks this season. Aaron Donald is returning after missing time last season and only recording 5 sacks. While Donald is coming off a down year, the best defensive tackle of all time is going to be a challenge for opposing offenses to start, no matter what stage of his career he is in. Donald will most likely be a major hedge in the run game, keeping the Seahawks' Kenneth Walker and Zach Charbonnet in check on inside runs. Expect Donald to be a menace and record numerous pressures in this season opener.

**EDGEs Uchenna Nwosu, Darrell Taylor, and Boye Mafe vs. T Joe Noteboom and Rob Havenstein**

The Seahawks have a very deep EDGE group, headlined by second-year Seahawk Uchenna Nwosu, 2020 second-round pick Darrell Taylor, and 2022 second-round pick Boye Mafe. The Rams have Joseph Noteboom starting after former Ram Andrew Whitworth retired. Rob Havenstein has held on the right tackle position as a formidable tackle. With the deep EDGE group they have, the Seahawks will be able to rotate their EDGEs throughout the entire game and feast on a weak Rams' offensive tackle group. The EDGEs will win this matchup with multiple sacks and be a key cog for Seattle's defensive game plan.

**WRs DK Metcalf and Tyler Lockett vs. CBs Derion Kendrick and Cobie Durant**

The Rams' secondary has fallen apart in recent years with the losses of Darious Williams and Jalen Ramsey. Derion Kendrick and Cobie Durant would be clear backups on any other team in the NFL, but with the Rams' all-out Super Bowl win two years ago, they are paying the prices now with very little cap room. The Seahawks' wide receiving core should feast on the Rams' secondary and be the biggest reason why the Seahawks' offense scores this week. Expect Metcalf and Lockett to have huge games, with Jaxon Smith-Njigba winning in the middle against a weak LB core and slot cornerback.

**CBs Tariq Woolen and Tre Brown vs. WRs Van Jefferson and Tutu Atwell**

After having surgery early in the offseason, Tariq Woolen has returned to the Seahawks in full health and is ready for the Seahawks' opener. Last year, CB Michael Jackson Sr. was starting for the Seahawks at left cornerback, but after having an inconsistent preseason, Tre Brown is now in the mix and will start. The Seahawks list Brown as the starter at LCB, but Carroll said both players will play. Regardless of who plays for the Seahawks at cornerback, the Rams are without star WR Cooper Kupp for the next 4 games, so the Seahawks' CBs should be able to fairly easily win the matchup against Van Jefferson and Tutu Atwell. Jefferson has been very inconsistent during his career and only a deep threat. Atwell was a second-round draft pick in 2021 and has not emerged as a reliable target.
