    Wide Receiver may be one of the most stacked positions the Seahawks have had in a long time. With the speed demon in Marquise Goodwin to the newly 3-year-extended DK Metcalf, this core has the potential to be the NFL's best this season. We will take an in-depth look at each player and what they bring to the table for the 2022--2023 season.

**DK Metcalf**

After receiving a well-deserved extension, DK Metcalf highlights a star-studded wide receiver core. With over 3000 yards in his first 3 seasons, DK Metcalf resides in elite company throughout NFL history. Guaranteed a roster spot, Metcalf is poised for a great season if Geno Smith beats out Drew Lock due to the effectiveness displayed during the 3.25 games last year when Geno Smith was the starter. Coming off a season with an injured foot Metcalf is primed for a good season.

**Tyler Lockett**

Looking back towards a 1175+ yard season and 3 back-to-back 1k seasons, Lockett looks to further display his consistency with either Geno Smith or Drew Lock under center. In comparison, DK Metcalf could produce with Geno Smith as the starter (4 Touchdowns), while Lockett couldn't grab a single touchdown. One of the most underrated wide receivers in the NFL, Lockett is 29 and will be 30 in September. Known for his quick speed and polished route running, Lockett may seem some regression towards his game in the upcoming years, knowing 30 is the usual downslope for most receivers.

**D'Wayne Eskridge**

After an injury-riddled 2021 with a brutal concussion and stingy toe pain, the former second-round pick could only produce 10 catches for 64 yards and 1 touchdown in 10 games. For reference, 2020 6th-round pick Freddie Swain was the third wide receiver for most of the year and posted 343 yards and 4 touchdowns. In games where Swain and Eskridge both played, Swain had more yards than D'Wayne in 5 games compared to Eskridge only having more yards than Swain in 3 games. With a new QB under center and 2 giants in Metcalf and Lockett above him in the depth chart, Eskridge could have a decent season contingent on the former second-round second-year pro staying healthy and using his unique versatility.

**Freddie Swain**

As aforementioned, Freddie Swain is a 6th-round pick similar to his predecessor in David Moore, is a late-round gem vying for the third wide receiver spot. Swain has been able to produce, even with a combination of an injured Wilson and Geno Smith producing 343 yards and 4 scores. Freddie's catches weren't checkdowns either as he averaged 13.7 yards per reception, higher than the "true deep threat" DK Metcalf's 12.9. Swain is still extraordinarily young and doubled his stats in his second year. While expecting him to beat out D'Wayne Eskridge, whom the team used a second-round pick on, and Marquise Goodwin, a polished veteran speed demon, would be ludicrous it isn't completely out of the realm of possibility. Expect him to make the roster as a 4th or 5th string WR.

**Marquise Goodwin**

Known best for being an Olympic athlete and being on the Seahawks' most fierce rival, Goodwin is a former 49er star who blazed past defenders with his Olympic speed. Like Swain and Eskridge, Goodwin is also rivaling for the third receiver spot. However, in contrast, Goodwin has 8 years under his belt providing immense experience, something most of the positional depth chart is missing. While Goodwin entering his 9th year can be seen as good it also shows he is much older and with age comes a decline in speed and injuries tend to spike. Goodwin will be 32 in November. At first, Marquise was seen as a "camp body", but by reports he has been impressing tremendously, implying he might be a viable number 3 option. With the keen interest Pete Carroll displayed once Goodwin was acquired, it seems he will make the final 53-man roster.

**Dareke Young**

Young was the second of 2 rookie wide receivers the Seahawks drafted in the seventh round. While we don't know much about his role in the offense we can assume it will be limited knowing the behemoths he needs to beat out in order to get any snaps. Drawing rave reviews and extreme similarities to Ricardo "Rocket" Lockette from Pete Carroll himself, Young could manage to make his way up the depth chart in the near future. I personally have Young making the roster as the 6th wide receiver due to his unique speed for his large frame.

**Bo Melton**

Unlike his counterpart 7th round receiver, Melton has an entirely different game. Melton is a full 4 inches shorter than Young creating this unique shiftiness and speed at the position. Rocking 81 Melton has an off chance to make the roster. I have Young over him because Young has impressed me and the Seahawks much more than Melton. There were reports that Drew Lock had also built a connection with Young providing a huge edge over Melton. The Seahawks usually run with 6 receivers and Melton would be the seventh on the roster. For the sole reasons of Young's good first impressions and his chemistry with Seattle's QBs, I would place Melton on the practice squad so he would be ready to be elevated if any injuries would occur to the wide receiver room.
