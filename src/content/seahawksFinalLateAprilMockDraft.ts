**Round 1, Pick 7: Jalen Carter DE**

Jalen Carter has been one of the most hyped-up prospects all throughout the year, being a leader on the staunch Georgia defense that has led them to command a top defense for 2 straight years. The Seahawks need a 3-4 DE as Jarran Reed may not be effective if he starts on one side, given his past performance of playing close to 40 snaps per game for teams that require defensive line pressure. To use Reed effectively, the Seahawks should consider having him as the third or fourth DE, playing 15-20 snaps per game. This could work well with Dre'Mont Jones starting across from Jalen Carter, potentially making Seattle's defense a top 5 contender. Additionally, Seattle's above-average secondary could benefit from a player like Carter, further improving their overall defense.

**Trade: Seahawks send 1.20 for 1.24 and 4.127**

**Round 1, Pick 24: Bryan Bresee DE**

The Seahawks understand their problems on the defensive line and don't hesitate to spend both their 1st round picks on 3-4 DE. Bresee is around the perfect weight for a DE and can sit for the Seahawks behind Jones and Reed. Bresee would hopefully emerge as a quality DE3 and beat out Reed by the end of the year, but if not, he could sit and Seattle would have zero problems starting him next year after he becomes more NFL-ready. Seattle's defense would improve tremendously from their revamped defensive line and above-average secondary and may catapult Seattle into the upper echelon of defenses in the 2023 season.

**Round 2, Pick 37: Josh Downs WR**

The Seattle Seahawks require a third wide receiver to support Tyler Lockett and DK Metcalf, and they cannot rely on the potential emergence of Dee Eskridge. While Dareke Young and Cade Johnson are promising options for the team's third receiver, their limited playing time last year doesn't provide a significant sample size to determine their potential. Therefore, the Seahawks plan to draft Josh Downs with their original late-second-round pick. Adding Downs could be the solution that Seattle has needed at the wide receiver position since David Moore, which would free up Metcalf and Lockett from double teams and give them more chances to showcase their talent as the top two options. With Downs, Metcalf, Lockett, and Fant as pass catchers, and Kenneth Walker in the backfield, Seattle's offensive personnel could be one of the best in the NFL with four elite receivers.

**Round 2, Pick 52: John Michael Schmitz C**

The Seahawks signed Evan Brown to a 1-year deal after his market never emerged in free agency. The signing of Brown is a perfect gateway for John into the NFL as he currently is a weak pass blocker and will need to improve to prove well in the NFL. Sitting behind Evan Brown may be the perfect option for John as he will learn the Waldron scheme and how to improve at both run and pass blocking to be NFL-ready. John will need to adjust to a zone scheme and understand the terminology before playing, but as the center of Seattle's "2nd" team, he will have a chance to adjust with Lock who already has been affiliated with the scheme during the 2022 season. Expect John to be a high-caliber center if he chooses to play his first snaps in the 2024 season, and sit for the year prior.

**Trade: Seahawks send 3.70 for 3.78 and 7.232.**

**Round 3, Pick 78: Daiyan Henley LB**

Daiyan Henley has displayed excellent coverage skills as a linebacker during his time at Washington State, which is becoming increasingly valuable in the NFL as the league evolves to a more pass-heavy style of play. With Jordyn Brooks injured and likely out for the season, Henley would immediately become the team's LB2 behind Bobby Wagner. Henley's coverage abilities would allow Wagner to focus more on run defense, an area in which he has excelled for the past decade. In the event that Brooks returns later in the season, Henley could complement him by taking on the coverage responsibilities and allowing Brooks to focus on his strength of run defense, which is why the Seahawks drafted him. It is expected that Henley will eventually win the starting job over Cody Barton as the season progresses, or potentially even start from day one and work through any initial struggles.

**Round 3, Pick 83: Zach Evans RB**

The Seahawks invest their 3rd round pick into running back, a spot where they have no depth. Currently, on Seattle's roster lays Kenneth Walker and DeeJay Dallas, both of whom were on the team last year. Walker will be the clear starter, but Dallas in an ideal situation should be RB3 or RB4. With Evans being drafted, Seattle gets a huge depth piece that will only ever play if Walker needs a break or an injury occurs. With Evans sitting behind Walker, he will have time to emerge and learn the scheme until the 2024 season when he can show out and become Seattle's clear RB2 option behind Walker.

**Round 4, Pick 123:Tre'Vius Hodges-Tomlinson CB**

Hodges-Tomlinson is a short corner that may seem odd of Seattle to spend their 4th-round draft pick on but is fairly realistic. Seattle in the past few years has understood that short corners can thrive in the NFL, proven by DJ Reed and Tre Brown, both of whom succeeded as Seahawks. Hodges-Tomlinson is 5'9 and will be placed at the outside corner or nickel depending on where Seattle best sees fit for him. Coby Bryant, while having an up-and-down season in his rookie year, does not have his starting nickel job secured, and while it is unlikely that Hodges-Tomlinson breaks Bryant away from his role, there is a slim chance that Hodges-Tomlinson starts. Worst case, Seattle has strong depth at the outside corner positions and nickel in case of injury.

**Round 4, Pick 127: Nick Herbig EDGE**

Nick Herbig had a top-30 visit with Seattle in the past month and for good reason. Last year Seattle was forced to sign Bruce Irvin to be a key cog in their EDGE room after it failed to produce early on. To avoid that, Seattle has been looking for younger options at the position to make sure they never warrant an emergency Bruce Irvin signing. Herbig could sit behind Boye Mafe as Mafe will be expected to play a much larger increment of snaps in his second year after being delegated to the clear EDGE3 in his rookie year. While Seattle has Tyreke Smith and Alton Robinson, both players never played a snap last year and the updates on their injuries are not clear enough for Seattle to believe they will be ready in week 1. Herbig adds some stability to an unclear EDGE depth chart behind its two key starters.

**Round 5, Pick 151: SirVocea Dennis LB**

SirVocea Dennis has risen up on draft boards in recent weeks. Dennis is a 23-year-old who will be 27 before he hits free agency after his rookie contract. While the age is a concern, if Seattle can get 5-7 years of production out of him before he starts to decline, the 5th-round pick will seem like a steal in a half-decade. Dennis provides some depth for Seattle as they currently have Jordyn Brooks out with a torn ACL and Devin Bush and Bobby Wagner as the starters. If Dennis beats Bush in camp he will start and Seattle will have very little financial obligation to Bush as he was signed to a cheap $2 million deal. Dennis is a sure-fire tackler that will provide assurance to a Seattle defense that had struggled with tackling for the majority of the 2022-2023 season. Expect Dennis to be depth for the majority of his rookie year next season.

**Round 5, Pick 154: Moro Ojomo DE**

Ojomo is a defensive lineman that has impressive lateral speed that has allowed him to make big plays in the run game and pass game. In the run game, Ojomo has been able to set the point of attack and set the edge against the offensive lineman. In the pass game, Ojomo has shown to be able at creating consistent pressure on the quarterback using a fast first step. Ojomo could be a backup to the Seahawks' current EDGE group with Darell Taylor, Boye Mafe, and Uchenna Nwosu, rotating in to keep the starters fresh while being able to stop the run and get some reps at pass rusher. This is similar to the role Boye Mafe had last year.

**Round 6, Pick 198: Evan Hull RB**

The Seahawks are planning to select Evan Hull as their second running back option, who excels as a 3rd-down back due to his impressive receiving skills. Hull possesses a powerful running style and has a talent for breaking tackles, making him an ideal power back to fill a gap in the Seahawks' roster. However, Hull's pass-blocking abilities are not yet up to par, which will need to be improved during his rookie season. Following the loss of Travis Homer in free agency, Hull would be an excellent addition to the Seahawks' team as a rotational running back behind Dallas and Johnson.

**Round 7, Pick 232: Jake Haener QB**

Haener is a slightly small but athletic QB with a fast release. He has great instincts with great accuracy and ball placement. He has the ability to make plays and is able to evade sacks at times. His biggest issue is his arm strength, which limits him from making big down-field throws. Haener could fit as the Seahawks' 3rd QB after they resigned both QBs Geno Smith and Drew Lock in free agency. This will give them a backup for Drew Lock if Geno Smith gets injured and a possible future backup option after Drew Lock's contract expires.

**Round 7, Pick 237: Elijah Higgins WR**

Higgins is a WR that has good physical tools but has not managed to convert that to production on the field. He is a very big receiver that specializes in the middle of the field while possessing good hands and a big catch radius. He is not a very good vertical threat, however, which limits his utility as a big slot. The Seahawks could use him as a backup or someone to even make the practice squad to come fill in when injuries pile up, which have occurred for the Seahawks wide receivers in the past few seasons.
