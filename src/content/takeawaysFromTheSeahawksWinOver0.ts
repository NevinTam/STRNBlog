    1. Special Teams

For once, the Seahawks did not mess up on a punt or an extra-point attempt. However, I do include this section as they badly messed up on punt coverage. Joey Blount is an undrafted free agent who joined the team early after the draft to provide depth to an oft-injured safety position. He managed to make the roster due to his special team prowess, but during the game, he made a fatal error that was dangerous and gave the opponent 15 free yards. In the grand scheme of the game, this turned out to be a minor inconvenience compared to previous games' mishaps, but still worth noting. Jason Myers has been excellent during this season, drastically improving from last season, and appearing to have rediscovered his 2020 kicking form once again. Micheal Dickson had a quiet game as he only punted once, while also not having any problems, compared to his last two games of drive and momentum-altering mistakes. Overall, a mostly complete performance that helped the Seahawks close out against the Los Angeles Chargers.

2. **Defensive Continuation**

The defense continued to show out, perhaps improving in some aspects from their complete domination in the Cardinals game. The pass coverage drastically turned from worst to best within a couple of weeks, forcing a highly-touted Justin Herbert under 300 yards with 2 touchdowns and an interception.

Ryan Neal:

Enter Ryan Neal, the safety who beat out Josh Jones in taking Jamal Adams' starting Strong Safety spot. After performing well enough against the Cardinals to warrant another opportunity, Neal completely showed out, recording an interception, while narrowly missing out on another. He also was extremely tight in coverage allowing only 4 completions on 9 targets for 28 yards. He consistently forced Justin Herbert to shy away from his side of the field. He recorded a whopping 4 pass breakups along with 7 tackles, both the highest and tied for the highest of the game for either team, respectively. Ryan Neal has out-proven his qualifications for this defense, perhaps being a key cog in why the defense had made a sudden turnaround.

Michael Jackson:

After taking the job from Sidney Jones IV and not turning back, the 25-year-old has only improved with each game, and today was by far his best game. To start off, Jackson had 5 tackles, tied for 4th highest for any defender for both teams on the day. His major headlines were the missed interceptions. One Jackson almost had but had understandably narrowly missed. The other one made every fan watching the game grin, including John Schneider who had a phenomenal reaction on the Nationally televised channel. Herbert seemed to have a misunderstanding with the former-Seahawks tight end, in which the QB expected Everett to turn outside and promptly pre-fired the ball, just for Everett to remain inside and the ball getting darted for Jackson, who bobbled it before ultimately letting it reach the turf. Jackson also had a pass defended raising his season total to 4. Michael allowed 3 completions on 8 targets for a minimal 22 yards. Jackson continues to allow limited receptions per game and will hope to keep his 20 yards allowed on average each game true against the New York Giants.

Tariq Woolen:

Remains the leader for DROY over Sauce Gardner, even with his 4-game streak of interceptions coming to an end. He allowed his first touchdown on the season, but it could've easily been stopped 5 yards short of the goal line if Barton decided to disengage his block and turn around. It also may have been covered if Woolen was not forced to move around a Chargers' player while covering the route, which set him behind, allowing for a simplistic touchdown. Regardless, Woolen remains a lockdown corner as evidenced by a deep throw that was almost intercepted, had it not been an overthrow but an accurately placed one. Tariq also allowed 2 completions on 4 targets for a slim 27 yards. Woolen recorded a pass breakup bringing his season total to 6 with 4 interceptions, compared to Gardner's 11 with 1 interception.

Quandre Diggs:

Diggs seemed to have regained his typical "Diggs" form along with the turnaround of the defense. It was presumed Diggs was making an abnormally large amount of mistakes because he was attempting to make up and cover for other Seattle defensive mistakes, but it was only an assumption. That guess may be true as Diggs returned to form, flying from the secondary to knock a ball out of Gerald Everett's hands. With the defense able to account for and prevent their own mistakes, Diggs may be able to continue to do what he does best, playing freely while delivering threatening hits.

Jordyn Brooks:

Jordyn Brooks has completely turned around this season from being able to finish tackles and getting more valuable tackles, not ones that cap off a blown coverage, but ones that prevent plays from emerging. Against the Chargers, he had zero missed tackles, with 8 total tackles. He also forced a fumble on the second Chargers' drive of the game from Austin Ekeler, but it ended up in the hands of an offensive Chargers player. From Weeks 1--4, while not being targetted once during week 3, Brooks allowed an astonishing 241 yards, with 131 of those coming against the Lions in week 4. During Weeks 5 and 6 he allowed 41 and also allowed 6 completions on 7 targets for just over 50 yards against the Chargers. Brooks had completely turned around and will need to keep the defense together if there is any hope for the remainder of the season.

Cody Barton:

He could've easily stopped Woolen's TD allowed in coverage but chose to get stuck in a block with RB Austin Ekeler and be turned completely in the opposite direction of the ball carrier. At times he seems to get stuck to blocks, not be able to disengage with blocks, gravitate towards blocks for no apparent reason, or not be able to find the ball carrier, resulting in him missing his gaps, and putting forth unnecessary explosive plays. Excluding the missed tackle on Woolen's TD, Barton played a much better game than weeks prior even with a slight increase of snaps this week compared to the Cardinals game. While on the field, Barton allowed 5 completions on 6 targets for a small 28 yards. Even though he still had numerous mistakes, I would not be opposed to seeing Barton get a similar amount of snaps next week onwards, as long as the mistakes don't grow. Overall, the defense has played a lot better in the nickel packages with Barton off the field, and will most likely continue to use their unique defensive backs to keep the play in front of them and entrust Brooks to man the middle of the field.

Darrell Taylor:

He has finally regained form. Taylor has a sack apiece during the 6th and 7th weeks of the season. He also recorded a forced fumble during both games. In the Arizona game, the fumble was recovered by the offense, but against the Chargers Taylor scooped up the ball and brought it to the opposing team's 20-yard line. Taylor has started to warm up and has been able to match his offseason hype with the latest two weeks. He also may have discovered a knack for knocking the ball out of the opposing quarterback's hands as they lean back to throw, with the specific scenario happening during both the Cardinals and Chargers matchups. Darrell has the potential to be a menace to quarterbacks and has shown that he can record sacks and turnovers, another reason the defense has turned around. Taylor is tied for 2nd in the NFL with 3 forced fumbles, only behind Seahawks' cornerback Coby Bryant who leads the NFL with 4.

Shelby, Quinton, Poona, and Myles Adams:

They have shown up. PERIOD. After Pete Carroll said they adjusted the scheme to allow them to play more aggressively and not read and act on what they see, this defensive line has played exceptionally. Ford has consistently made plays on the ball, batting down a pass each in both the game against Arizona and Los Angeles. Shelby Harris has gone from 2 pressures from weeks 1--5 to already 2 during weeks 6--7. Harris also batted two passes down at the line of scrimmage in week 7. Even Myles Adams got in on the action recording a single pressure and a quarterback knockdown in the game after being inactive for 3 weeks this year. Lastly, Quinton Jefferson combined during weeks 6 and 7 was able to record a hurry, 3 pressures, a sack in each game, 2 QB hits, and 7 total tackles, including 2 tackles for loss. They also held the Chargers' run game in check, only allowing 53 yards, for a grand total of 3.5 yards per carry. This defensive line has been the true spark for this defense's turnaround and will need to continue against the Giants in order to maintain a positive record.

Uchenna Nwosu:

Uchenna Nwosu now leads the ENTIRE NFL with 31 pressures on the season, including a career-high 11 pressures against the Chargers, according to Next Gen Stats. Nwosu has been consistently able to apply pressure on the quarterback, and while it may not result in him finishing with a sack, it opens up opportunities for others to get sacks. He has accumulated 13 tackles in the last 3 weeks alone. Rotating Nwosu and Taylor across each side may open opportunities for both and allow each to prosper within their own styles. Nwosu will need to continue to play as he has, in order to help allow the defense to keep its streak of 2 strong weeks.

Offense Successes:

Geno Smith:

Geno Smith has remained elite, even with a statistically "down" week against the Cardinals, with a completion percentage of 64.5%, a number that would be average in the NFL. He recorded a 74.07% completion percentage with 20 completions on 27 throws. Of those total 27 throws, two were for touchdowns to Marquise Goodwin and one was an interception that was targetted to Tyler Lockett, but unfortunately, the referees missed defensive pass interference, resulting in the ball being batted up for the Charger's Kenneth Murray to catch for an interception. Geno Smith is now on track to eclipse more passing yards than Aaron Rodgers, Russell Wilson, Lamar Jackson, and Jalen Hurts. He also is on track to obtain more rushing yards than Mahomes, Wilson, Burrow, and Herbert. Smith has played a complete game so far this season and will need to continue to do so even if the offense remains without DK Metcalf.

Fant, Dissly, Parkinson:

These tights are on track to get 1200 yards combined by the end of the season. For reference, the Seahawks currently have 500+ yards allocated to their tight ends, just shy of their entire 2021 season mark of 750+. They have combined for 5 of Geno Smith's 11 touchdowns all season. Will Dissly had another impressive game, turning every single one of his catches into first downs. Parkinson ripped off a beautiful catch and run, showing off extremely impressive speed for the 6 feet 7-inch behemoth. Noah Fant also had few opportunities to catch more than his 1 completion, but both were highly contested throws that Fant had a chance to grab, but a slim one at most. All 3 of them proved as phenomenal blockers, having paved the way for Rashaad Penny's elite runs along with currently paving the way for K9, especially on his 74-yard touchdown run.

Eskridge:

D'Wayne Eskridge's box score may have not been impressive, even with the chance to emerge as a viable option with DK Metcalf's injury, but that was partly because Goodwin had a breakout game and Eskridge was excellent in run blocking, thus the increased usage in paving way for Seattle's backfield. Eskridge and Parkinson were key blockers on K9's game-sealing run, putting the final defenders with a chance to tackle Walker out of the equation. I hope Eskridge can emerge as a quality wide receiver, especially with DK Metcalf perhaps out for a week, but if not the team must continue to use his run-blocking prowess for the betterment of the team, not his stats.

Offensive Line, especially the Rookie Tackles:

Coming into this game, Khalil Mack had 6 sacks and 9 pressures. Exiting the game he had the exact same stat line, due to the likes of Rookie tackles Charles Cross and Abraham Lucas. Mack, in fact, had the worst game of his season, ranked an abysmal sub-50 grade by PFF. While it may not be because Mack was bad, it may be because the tackles held up, as shown by the previous 6 games. Cross and Lucas have allowed 6 total sacks, a marginal amount compared to Smith's 16 total sacks taken this year. While the guards have not performed as well as their potential, they also played well, only allowing 2 sacks, one being by third-string guard Jake Curhan. Austin Blythe has also played exceptionally in pass-blocking, recording the 6th highest pass-block win rate of all centers. Their main headline comes from their run blocking, a unit with the help of receivers and tight ends helped Walker achieve 168 yards for 7.3 yards per carry. If this run blocking can persist, the Seahawks will be a menace on offense with their run and pass game, respectively.

Kenneth Walker III, K9:

The best RB of the season in the last 3 weeks. The longest play for the Seahawks all season. Leading the Seahawks to their highest yard per carry in any season in franchise history. Leading the Seahawks to the highest yards per attempt for the 2022 season. Enter Kenneth Walker, or K9, their star-studded second-round rookie, who has emerged as one of the best this season. After Rashaad Penny ended his season with a gruesome leg injury, Walker wasted no time as he launched into action posting elite numbers. In his 3 starts from Weeks 5--7, Walker has posted 353 yards on 52 carries, for an NFL-high 6.8 yards per attempt since the Saints game. He has a perfect combination of power in his upper and lower body, quick change of direction, incredible vision, and unimaginable speed, as shown by his 74-yard touchdown run that was the highest speed for any ball carrier this year. The combination of the attributes said above makes him someone NFL defenses will need to freight about for years to come.
