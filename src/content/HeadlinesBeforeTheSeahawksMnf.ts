**1. To be Cheered or to be Booed...**

Russell Wilson will be entering Lumen Field as a member of the Denver Broncos on the MNF Season Opener on September 12th. Many have debated but with no decided answer Wilson will most likely receive a mix of praises and insults. How fans treat their quarterback of a decade and 2 time Super Bowl Quarterback will be solely up to the fans and their respect for the 33-year-old.

**2. Which offensive line will stand its ground?**

A reason why Wilson decided to book it to Denver was that he felt the offensive line in Seattle was inadequate and unable to protect him. While this may be debated how true it was one would expect the offensive line in Denver to be much better given Wilson's quick turnaround. With Seattle's new switch to a 3-4 only time will tell if Wilsons' offensive line will be more consistent or if Seattle had the better offensive line all along.

**3. Battle of the Run Games**

Wilson escaped Seattle because he wanted to "air it out" and stop running the ball; we knew that. We know with Geno Smith being the starting quarterback and the Seahawks having a plethora of capable running backs, the Seahawks will look to run it more than they did even in Wilsons' early years. However, the Denver Broncos also enjoy running the ball, especially given they have 2 running back 1s attempting to split carries. The major question comes down to which team will run the ball more, more effectively, and will either offense be able to effectively pass the ball with the mass amounts of running? If the Seahawks run the ball the most Russell will know he made the right decision leaving, but if the Broncos decide to rush most of the game and not use Wilson as a passer, Wilson will contemplate if Denver was the right decision.

**4.Who has the better safety group?**

Both the Seahawks and Broncos boast an impressive safety corps. The Broncos have 2021 second-team all pro safety Justin Simmons at FS and veteran Kareem Jackson at SS. The Seahawks employ (as many of you know), 2022 pro bowler FS Quandre Diggs and former all-pro SS Jamal Adams. Simmons is one of the top safeties in today's game and is able to cover a wide range in Fangio's defensive system, allowing Jackson to create plays closer to the line of scrimmage while Simmons plays deep safety. The Seahawks employed a similar dynamic in the 2020 season with Diggs earning a Pro Bowl nod playing deep safety and Adams playing closer to line of scrimmage, allowing Adams to break the sack record for a defensive back and earn all-pro honors in his first year in Seattle. However, in 2021 the Seahawks instead employed more Cover 2 looks, dropping Adams and Diggs to drop back into coverage. While this still allowed Diggs to excel as a FS, it limited Adams role as a game-wrecker at the line of scrimmage. Under new DC Clint Hurtt and Assistant Sean Desai, it has been known that the Seahawks are shifting to a more aggressive defense, allowing Adams to return to the role he had in 2020. With Adams ability to be one of the best hybrid linebackers in the game, and Diggs being one of the best ball-hawking safeties in the league, I believe they are one of the best safety duos in the league when healthy, surpassing even Broncos duo.

**5.How would Seattle's new defense look like?**

As told in the last point, the new Seattle defense, led by new DC Clint Hurtt and HC Assistant Sean Desai, intends to be new aggressive form of defense. Specifically, this means more blitzing from LBs, more usage of man coverage within plays, and a shift to a more 3-4 style of defense. Another key component to this defense is how to utilize SS Jamal Adams, who is a rare talent at his position when utilized correctly. Hurtt and Desai have mentioned that they want to still keep the Cover 2 usage seen under previous DC Ken Norton Jr with the aggressive blitzing from Fangio's scheme. We will get a much better look at this new defense after seeing the starters in week 1.

**6.What might we expect from the new Broncos offense with Wilson and Hackett?**

We should expect a similar type of west-coast offense that Waldron employed with the Seahawks and Wilson in 2021. This is due to Wilson's unique play style that he uses to extend plays and scramble out of the pocket. Another similarity is in the types of receivers present in the offense. Courtland Sutton is similar to DK Metcalf in that they are both dominant "X" receivers that can win on contested catches. Tyler Lockett is similar to KJ Hamler as they are both "Y" receivers that use their speed to take the top off the defense. Jerry Jeudy will play in the slot in Denver's offense, but Russ has historically not thrown to check-downs or underneath as much, partially leading to his struggles last year when returning from finger surgery.

**7.How might Waldron's offense look in year two with Geno as QB1?**

From what we saw from Smith last year, we can expect a more conservative offense from Geno based on check downs and running the ball. However, the Seahawks run game didn't heat up last year until after Wilson came back, making us wonder what the Geno led offense could've been with Rashaad Penny in breakout form. Geno also has no problem throwing over the middle of the field, something Russ had issues with at times last season. We can also expect to Waldron's play calling to improve as he gets more comfortable calling plays in his second year.
