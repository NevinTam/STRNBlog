**Geno Smith**

Geno Smith had a good game on Sunday but wasn't able to put it all together to seal off a game winning drive. He was able to pick apart the raiders defense with short completions but had a couple turnover worthy plays and not being able to lead the game-winning drive when given 2 chances. Smith was also under pressure quite a bit during the game but was able to create plays while on the run, including on a late 4th quarter touchdown to Travis Homer.

**Kenneth Walker**

Kenneth Walker continued his downward trend against the Raiders, getting completely stopped by the porous Raiders defensive line. This is the 3rd time in 4 games Walker has been held to under 50 yards rushing and shows a clear inefficiency in the offense, as without the run game the offense has struggled to gain consistency, such as in this Raiders game where late they weren't able to convert and keep the offense on the field. In part this is due to the run blocking of the offensive line, but also due to Walker's vision, which has him bouncing a lot of his runs outside, which at times leads to run stuffs and TFLs. When Walker took over the starting job, many thought that he would be just as good as Rashaad Penny as a rookie, but it's clear that he has a little bit to learn before he can recreate Penny's dominant run at the end of 2021.

**Offensive Line**

The Offensive Line had one of their worst games this season against the Raiders. They were not able to generate much of a push in the run game against one of the worse defensive lines, and allowed lots of interior pressure, specifically from DT Andrew Billings. One player from the Seahawks who did bad on the interior was C Austin Blythe, who went up against Billings for much of the game. On the edge, Maxx Crosby had several big plays, beating RT Abraham Lucas to get 1.5 sacks on Geno Smith, both drive killing 3rd-down sacks, including one on their final OT possession.

**Defense Line**

The Defensive Line reverted to their form in the first part of the season, where they were not able to put pressure on anyone and allowed opponents to run all over them. In this game, specifically, it looked as if the interior of the defensive line was getting moved around easily, leading to big holes that sprung Raiders RB Josh Jacobs for big runs to gash the Seahawks run defense. Outside of the first defensive drive, the Seahawks were unable to put pressure on Raiders QB Derek Carr, allowing him to pick the Seahawks defense apart on long drives, contributing to the Raiders having a 37:28 time of possession lead.

**Quandre Diggs**

Quandre Diggs had one of his best games of the season this week, returning to his ball-hawking form by getting 2 acrobatic picks on QB Derek Carr after not recording any for the past 11 weeks. While Diggs recorded 2 interceptions, he still had some mistakes in coverage, including allowing a touchdown to RB Ameer Abdullah on a wheel route, as well as not helping LB Jordyn Brooks on the late 4th-quarter touchdown that tied the game up, sending it to overtime. Overall, it is good to see Diggs return to more like himself in coverage, at least, as so far this year he seems to have taken a bit of a hit in quality play following his leg-injury he suffered at the end of last season.

**Ryan Neal and Josh Jones**

Ryan Neal played well in coverage this game, allowing only one catch for 7 yards on 4 targets. One mistake he had, however, was dropping an interception that could have changed the momentum for the Seahawks, as following that the Raiders scored a touchdown. Neal also got injured in the final quarter of the game, leading to Josh Jones being subbed in for him. Jones did not play well, and in fact was a big part in allowing Josh Jacobs to run for 86 yards on the last play of the game, as he took a bad angle and was not able to stop Jacobs's momentum before he could break the tackle. Such poor play in run defense from Jones and the current injury to Neal (making him questionable for Sunday's game against the Rams), has led the Seahawks to pick up Johnathan Abram off waivers as depth, who might even pass Jones on the depth chart with time.
