**QB Geno Smith vs Cardinals Secondary**

So far starting off the season, Smith has not had the same incredible run he had last season, but is still playing efficiently and dissecting opposing defenses. However, against the Bengals last week, he had an uncharacteristically poor game against the Bengals last week. He had a few incomplete throws and an awful interception throwing into triple coverage when targeting WR Jaxon Smith-Njigba. Look for Smith to rebound (like he usually does) this week against a struggling Cardinals secondary who will likely be without their best corner, Antonio Hamilton. The Cardinals will be getting key reinforcements with safety Budda Baker coming back, so the Seahawks may utilize more short and intermediate concepts with tight ends like they were doing in the beginning of the season with LT Charles Cross and RT Abraham Lucas out.

**Seahawks Run Defense vs Cardinals Rushing Attack**

One of the highlights of the Cardinals offense has been their rushing attack, which has been a key part of their competitiveness this year. RB James Connor has been incredibly efficient to start the year, averaging over 5.3 YPC behind the Cardinals O-Line. The Seahawks are well matched to defend against this, as they have sported a top-tier rushing defense this year, helmed by LB Bobby Wagner. They are currently allowing a league leading 3.2 YPC. If the Seahawks can stop the Cardinals strong rushing attack, they can keep the offense one-dimensional and provide more opportunities to the offense to keep scoring points.

**Seahawks Rushing Attack vs Cardinals Run Defense**

The Seahawks will be without Rookie RB Zach Charbonnet entering this game. THis means Kenneth Walker will remain the lead back with mainly special teamer RB DeeJay Dallas taking snaps as the second running back. The Cardinals have a very lackluster front-7, even with spending numerous top picks on linebackers in the first round, just for them to not pan out. Walker has 6 TDs in just 5 games and is on pace for 20 TDs on the season. While he may not reach this, it goes to show his skill at finding the endzone. The Cardinals have former Seahawks first-round pick LJ Collier on IR and will struggle to stop Walker. While the Seahawks offensive line is beat up, they have everyone back except for their right tackle, suggesting Walker will still be able to dominate.

**Seahawks Secondary vs Cardinals Receivers**

The Seahawks have quickly emerged as one of the best secondaries in the NFL, holding Burrow to just 14 points on drives that did not amount from offensive turnovers. The week before, they sacked QB Daniel Jones 11 times, a MNF record, helping their secondary lock down a week Giants receiving core. The Seahawks should be able to replicate their success against a bad, but not league-worst, secondary of the Cardinals. The Cardinals lost DeAndre Hopkins in the offseason, but will have former first round pick Marquise Brown back in action. While Woolen and Witherspoon should not have problems defending the speedy receiver, Seattle should be careful and not become too aggressive. Expect the Seahawks secondary to dominate the Cardinals receivers all game.
