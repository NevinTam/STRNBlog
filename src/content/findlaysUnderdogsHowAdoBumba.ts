First play of my college career. I just came down and I hit 'em as hard as I could ... I'm like 'Oh yeah, we out here'

Adonai Bumba, one of Findlay's premier safeties, is at a key point in his young college career. Heading into his junior year, he's entering his second year as a starter and is primed to make a huge jump as a veteran on the team. We recently got to speak to Adonai and learn more about his journey has he progresses

Adonai is originally from Urbana, Illinois. He originally started looking to play college football in this area until Findlay DC Thomas Rebholz invited him to check out the Findlay campus and organization. He felt a very positive vibe from many of the players and coaches, which was part of what compelled him to join Findlay.

"The players that were currently on the team, I felt like were very similar to players that I hung out with at home"

Part of that culture stems from HC Kory Allen, who helped reestablish and cultivate this sentiment at Findlay after being promoted to HC only 2 years ago. This familial aspect that brings many players to Findlay has been upheld by almost every player going through the Findlay program.

Along with HC Allen, DC Rebholz, who recruited Adonai out of high school, has played a key role in the culture and development of many players at Findlay.

"He taught me a lot about the game that I didn't know ... Coming in from high school, we didn't do too much defensively ... learning ball at the collegiate level is way different from high school. Having Coach Reb explain things to me and break certain things down

Another person on the Findlay campus that has helped elevate Adonai's game was WR Cam Childers. Childers used to play in the slot where he lined up against Adonai almost everyday in practice, which was a huge learning experience.

Some other memorable moments at Findlay for Adonai were several football games, including Findlay's most recent game against Ashland which went into quadruple overtime.

"It was just a crazy experience ... I actually had a play where I had a PBU when they were going for one of their 2 pt conversions, it was just crazy"

Another important game for Adonai was his first game as a sophomore last season, where he won the starting job for the first time, which had built up a lot of anticipation for him.

"On the very first play of the game, I was playing the middle of the field. The running back got the ball and the hole opened up, and it was just me and him ... really, first play of my college career. I just came down and I hit 'em as hard as I could ... I'm like 'Oh yeah, we out here'"

Adonai mentions that when he has the opportunity to make a big play, he tries to keep his mind sharp before the ball is snapped.

"I feel like if there's too much going through your head, you've already lost. Right before the play I'm going through my pre-snap progression ... my head's on a swivel because while I'm looking for the play, I'm looking at what formation they're getting in, what personnel they have in on the field ... just so I can anticipate what I'm getting based on film study during the week"

Playing safety, Adonai has a unique position that allows him to play in multiple areas of the field. He can play from within the box, close to the line of scrimmage. He can also play deep in coverage, making moves based on anticipation and reading the quarterback. Adonai enjoys both of these parts of playing football and can play either if need be.

"Honestly, I like both. I just like being on the field playing football. I like getting into the box, hitting people, but I also like playing deep and making plays in the passing game... manipulate the quarterback, things of that nature. I can play zone, but I like playing man, you know manned up in the slot ... I just love being out there honestly."

If he had to choose, however, he mentions that defending the run, coming downhill is what excites him the most.

When it comes to Adonai's personal experience with Findlay, he mentions that he enjoys the simplistic nature of the classes with the emphasis on student life. He can go to student events all week and be able to have a more personal connection with his various professors, including those in Computer Science, which is what Adonai's chosen to major in.

"The way the world's going right now, a lot of things are online and digital ...I'm really interested in the online aspect, the coding aspect ... I'm a problem solver, so I really enjoy that"

Adonai's family and friends have had a huge positive impact on him, not just in his football development, but in almost all facets of his life.

"They've definitely have had a big positive impact on everything I do in my life. When I'm out there, I'm the only one from our school that's from where I'm from. I feel like I gotta represent my whole community, not even just my family and friends. They are all behind me, every time I step out"

One piece of advice that Adonai has for any DB's out there that are pushing to make it to the college level or win the starting job is to find a role model or mentor to help guide you through your journey.

"Learn from them...use it to critique what you do. Try to record that person that you know who understands the game, who has played and understands defensive back. The thing I see with young kids going into college is that they want to work and put in the hours, but if they're working on things that aren't gonna help you ... you're just wasting time or building bad habits. You never want to do that, that'll set you back rather than set you forward"
