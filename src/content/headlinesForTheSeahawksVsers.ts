**T Charles Cross and Jason Peters vs. EDGE Chase Young and Nick Bosa**

The Seahawks will unfortunately be without tackle Abe Lucas this game, despite Lucas recording a full practice on Wednesday. This leaves Jason Peters as their starter who will block against Nick Bosa. This is not a good matchup for Seattle in any aspect and should be part of their game plan to help Peters out. Charles Cross should be able to handle his own against Chase Young. The addition of Chase Young to the 49ers defense has reignited Nick Bosa who has 3.5 sacks in the last 3 games. Young also has 3.5 sacks in the last 4 games and will be a tough matchup for the Seahawks on the exterior of the offensive line.

As the Seahawks have done in recent games, Stone Forsythe may enter the game for Jason Peters at right tackle to alleviate the workload on 41-year-old Peters to keep him fresh for more of the game. The problem with this rotation is Forsythe is very bad pure pass-blocking and Peters is far better in that aspect of the game, but he has been called for numerous drive-killing penalties in the last few games. The Seahawks will need a lot of plays where the tight end helps block with Peters or at least chips the EDGE defender if they want to keep Geno Smith upright for most of this game.

**DEs Leonard Williams, Jarran Reed, and Dre'Mont Jones vs. G Jon Feliciano and Ben Bartch**

As of now, Aaron Banks and Spencer Burford are questionable for the 49ers, but Burford is a longshot to play, while Banks has a better chance. So, for the purpose of this, the 49ers guards for the Thursday Night Football matchup will be Jon Feliciano and Ben Bartch. Feliciano has played a solid season for the 49ers so far in a reserve role, not allowing a single or sack or having a penalty called on him. He is up there with age, turning 32 during the month of the Super Bowl. Ben Bartch was signed from the Jacksonville Jaguars practice squad just a few days ago and may need to start if Banks is not ready to go.

Leonard Williams, Jarran Reed, and Dre'Mont Jones are a strong pass-rush group and should be able to beat up against a weak guard room, especially with 2 backup guards expected to start. Dre'Mont Jones has slowly been rounding the corner on the Seattle defense, consistently getting pressures in his last few games, despite not getting sacks. Jarran Reed has been a menace in the 1st half of games but is mostly worn out by the 2nd half. Leonard Williams has been very valuable on the defensive front and will hope to do so again against a weak 49ers IOL.

**WRs DK Metcalf and Tyler Lockett vs. CBs Charvarius Ward and Demmodore Lenoir**

DK Metcalf and Tyler Lockett are better WRs than Ward and Lenoir and cornerbacks. However, Ward is not afraid to get physical with Metcalf and always gives Metcalf his toughest battles. Lenoir is on the shorter side at 5'10 and will matchup with Lockett who is the same height. The last time these 2 teams faced, DK Metcalf has an elite outing with 136 yards and 2 touchdowns. Lockett had a quiet game with 6 receptions only for 40 yards. This was a game where the offense had the lead entering the 2nd half but faltered as the game progressed.

Tyler Lockett is a savvy veteran and will need to show that against a younger cornerback in Lenoir who is only 24 years of age. It will help the Seahawks, however, that the 49ers will be without their All-Pro safety from last year Hufanga who is out for the season with a torn ACL. This means that the Seahawks WR duo will have less worry about getting double-teamed with Hufanga's backup Ji'Ayir Brown starting. If the Seahawks want to win this game, this may be the matchup they will need to very desperately win if they want to come out of this game with the division in their hands and only half a game behind the 2nd seed Lions, who they have the tiebreaker over from their head-to-head matchup, meaning if they win this week and next week while the Lions lose next week, they will only be behind the Eagles in the seeding for the NFC Conference.
