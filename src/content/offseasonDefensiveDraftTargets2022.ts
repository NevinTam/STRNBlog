    title: 'Seahawks 2022 Offseason Defensive Draft Targets',
    description: 'On the defensive side of the ball, the Seahawks made numerous “quiet” free agency moves, signing many players to smaller contracts. However, after free agency, the Seahawks still have some big needs on the defensive side of the ball that they will look to address in the 2022 NFL Draft.',

## **Tier 4 Need**

#### DT: As previously stated the Seahawks are switching to a 3–4 scheme meaning they need a “big man” upfront. Resigning Al Woods could be a major lead as to him being the starter. The Seahawks also tendered ERFA Bryan Mone who could get quality snaps at NT, as Poona Ford is speculated to be on the small side for a 3–4 NT. Al Woods with his age, and Poona Ford with his necessity at DE, may make the team draft one with a Day 3 Pick.

## **Tier 3 Need**


#### OLB: The Seahawks understood they needed personnel to fit the 3–4 and went out and brought Uchenna Nwosu, an undervalued player who can rush the passer and cover. He will play alongside Darrell Taylor, providing a young and lethal OLB position but the extremely limited depth behind them. Drafting a potential project may be the best option, otherwise, the position is set.

## **Tier 3 Need**

#### ILB: The Seahawks did not reach out to any free agents except for a special teamer in Joel Iyiegbuniwe; however, he could create competition with Cody Barton for the second ILB. Jordyn Brooks will take over one inside spot but Barton and Iyiegbuniwe are both unproven so the Seahawks may be looking to draft one. Nevertheless, they seem to be set at ILB depth but could easily improve in the draft.

## **Tier 2 Need**

#### Outside CB: The Seahawks went out and were able to get subtle corners to create a CB competition. They have Tre Brown, who performed well but was injured, Artie Burns, a former first-round pick who played decent last season, and Sidney Jones IV, who played well last season after being a reclamation project. While Sidney Jones IV could take on one spot the other spot remains wide open with Tre Brown coming off an injury and Artie Burns is at best decent. They have potential within this group of outside corners, but a true CB1 may be tempting for the Seahawks.

## **Tier 1 Need**

#### Nickel CB: The competition for Nickel includes Justin Coleman, a solid nickel, Ugo Amadi, young but struggled last season, and Marquise Blair, high potential but injured. Newly acquired CB Artie Burns can also play nickel, meaning that the Seahawks have a fierce competition at nickel that will likely play out till training camp.

## **Tier 4 Need**


#### FS: Free Safety is not a need with the resigning of Quandre Diggs. Diggs manages to always get his hands on the ball and plays at a near-elite level. The only thing that could be concerning is the lack of depth behind him after he came from a gruesome leg injury. Though he is expected to recover fully behind the oft-injured Marquise Blair the Seahawks may want to think about drafting one late to play behind their star in Quandre Diggs.

## **Tier 4 Need**

#### SS: Strong Safety, similarly to Free Safety, is topped with one of the best safeties in the league in Jamal Adams. Adams has improved drastically in coverage over the last year but is unable to play a full season without getting injured. The only other option behind him is Ryan Neal, a sufficient safety with extremely limited experience. Neal has proven durable but it may be a concern with him only. Nonetheless, the Seahawks are set with their starter 2 SS.

## **Tier 4 Need**

# **Overall Seattle Defensive Needs Rankings:**

### **Tier 1 Need** — Outside CB

### **Tier 2 Need** — ILB

### **Tier 3 Need** — DT, OLB

### **Tier 4 Need** — DE, FS, SS, Nickel CB


### In the upcoming 2021 NFL draft, the Seahawks have many options they can go with their premier selections. With their first pick, the Seahawks could go CB and get one of the top corners in the draft, or instead with their 2nd or 3rd round picks draft key depth along OLB and ILB. The Seahawks as of right now are in a “rare position” for them to have multiple premier picks, so it will be intriguing to see how they will use them in the draft this Thursday.
