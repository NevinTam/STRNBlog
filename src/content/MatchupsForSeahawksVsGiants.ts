**1.** **Seahawks Run Defense vs Giants RB Saquon Barkley and Giants QB Daniel Jones**

The Seahawks played downright horrendously in run defense during the first few weeks of the season, culminating in a Week 5 game against the Saints where TE Taysom Hill and RB Alvin Kamara both had over 100 yards rushing. While Hill was listed at TE, he took the majority of his snaps at QB, which is concerning seeing how in the following game, while the Seahawks were able to limit the Cardinals rushing attack, they allowed Kyler Murray to gain 100 yards as a rusher. Containing Barkley will be key to stopping the Giants offense that gains over 170 yards per game on the ground, as he is the league leader in scrimmage yards. Daniel Jones has also become a threat as a runner, going over a 100 yards against the Jaguars most recently. The Seahawks will have to contain both in order to keep the Giants offense grounded.

**2. Seahawks RB Kenneth Walker III vs Giants Run Defense**

The Seahawks have had a revelation at running back with Kenneth Walker. Walker is currently 3rd in YPC at 6.1 and has played outstandingly in his first two starts against the Chargers and Cardinals. The Giants have played notably as well - for all the wrong reasons. They have the league ranked last in YPC allowed, setting up a favorable matchup for Walker. It will be needed as the Seahawks are not 100% at reciever with Metcalf and Lockett both questionable.

**3. Seahawks WRs DK Metcalf and Tyler Lockett vs Giants CBs Adoree Jackson and Fabian Moreau**

The Seahawks are questionable at receiver with injuries at both starter positions. Even if both play, they will both probably not be at 100%, making it even more critical for the run game to be on point today. Jackson and Moreau have played well to start the season as well, allowing 50% and 300 yards through 7 games. Moreau has been primarily a backup but has played well in his 3 starts, allowing 150 yards and under 50% completion rate in his games started. Look for this to be one the Seahawks may lose with their current situation at WR.

**4. Giants OLB Kayvon Thibedeoux and OLB Quincy Roche vs Seahawks OT Abraham Lucas and OT Charles Cross**

The Seahawks rookie tackle duo has played well so far this season, and that continued last week against the Chargers, holding Khalil Mack to his worst game of the season. The Seahawks will have to contain the Giants defense, especially if they want to establish the run against a weaker Giants run defense. They will be going against No. 7 Overall pick in Kayvon Thibedeoux, who has played well to start the season so far, making it even more critical that they stop them to establish a strong run defense and play solid defense.
