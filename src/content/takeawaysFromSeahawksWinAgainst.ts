**Offensive Passing Game Takes Off**

For the second straight week, the Seahawks kept a strong passing game up. QB Geno Smith was dealing darts all game against the Panthers, mostly within the short-intermediate range, which allowed the offense to move down the field. The biggest problem, however, was the Seahawks issues in the red zone and third-down. The Seahawks went 3-13 on third down all day, and just 3-6 in the red zone. Many of these red zone errors occurred in the first half, where the Seahawks leaned heavily on the passing game and were not able to convert as much. Geno had some great passes in the first half, but also had an ugly pick and a subpar completion percentage than what we are used to. However, after the halftime break, the Seahawks were able to utilize the pass more periodically, only needing to pass 12 times the entire second half. Geno only had one incompletion in this half and converted several big throws as he kept the offense moving. The offensive line played great today as well, with at times having almost 4 starters out, they were able to limit pressure on Smith (especially in the second half), allowing the offense to maintain it's consistency.

The trend of using tight-ends frequently continued this week. Even with Will Dissly out, Noah Fant and Colby Parkinson picked up the slack, totaling almost 80 yards and 7 catches between them, which were crucial for the Seahawks moving the chains. The Seahawks also heavily utilized RB Kenneth Walker in the passing game, something he has not been well known to do. Walker had a highlight play on a 1st and 25, where he caught a 36 yard go-route and was able to move the chains after a huge penalty the play prior by DK Metcalf. Speaking of Metcalf, he again had a great game, this time totaling over 110 yards for the first time on the season on just 6 catches. While Lockett had a quieter day on offense, with just 3 catches for 36 yards, the impressive Seahawks duo did just enough to pick apart the Panthers injured secondary.

The Seahawks passing attack also had some contributions from their rookies in the passing game. While Jaxon Smith Njigba has still not made the huge contribution we are all waiting for, he has not had a huge snap share due to the offensive tackle issue at hand for the 'Hawks, forcing them to use more TE-sets that would take Njigba off the field. The Seahawks have also been using rookie Jake Bobo more recently, mostly as a run blocker, but in this game he had his first receiving touchdown with an excellent toe-tap in the back of the end zone after catching the ball from Geno. Bobo has defied all expectations and truly cemented himself as WR4 on the team after a great camp and preseason in terms of receiving and blocking.

**Rushing Attack Starts Heating Up**

The Seahawks rushing attack has not been great through the past two weeks. And it wasn't really there either during the first half of this game. However, in the second half, the Seahawks were able to get a huge push out of their offensive line on the Panthers defense, allowing running backs Kenneth Walker and Zach Charbonnet to chain good runs to convert the chains and wear down the Panthers defense, contributing heavily to 2 of the Seahawk touchdown drives.

Kenneth Walker was the main back today, rushing for almost 100 yards and 2 touchdowns, while utilizing his incredible speed and agility to make guys miss. After 3 weeks, he has the 2nd most missed tackles forced (19) in the entire NFL. His contact balance has been incredible, and will definitely be a great weapon for the Seahawks ahead. One issue with Walker is that at times he has been a little too shifty - at times he will run more horizontal than vertical losing valuable yardage. Now, combine the shiftiness of Walker with what we got from Charbonnet: Straight, hard running using straight-line speed and power. Charbonnet was featured in the 3rd and 4th quarters, and had a physical style of running that continued to wear down the Panthers. Charboneet had 46 yards on just 9 carries, averaging over 5 yards a carry on his limited opportunities.

The offensive line also played great entering the second half, opening up bigger rushing lanes that helped relieve pressure from Geno Smith, allowing the Seahawks to use a wider part of their playbook and control the game more on a tempo wise. This is evident in just the attempts taken by both teams. The Seahawks, with a balanced pass-rush formula, had Geno just throwing 36 times compared to Dalton's 58 times. While Dalton played as well as he could, it's difficult to beat a team that can run it's offense with this much consistency in the closing part of the game.

**The 12th Man**

A huge storyline heading into the game was the honoring of the 2013 Seahawks, who nearly a decade ago won the Seahawks first super bowl and were part of the vaunted Legion of Boom defense that made Seattle known for top-notch defense in the early to mid 2010's. This game felt, in a way, similar to the games that would be played by those teams. Great rushing attack. Stifling run defense, and most importantly, a great standout performance from the 12s in the stands by raising the crowd volume.

The 12s have been known to be so loud that they have caused earthquakes before, and on Sunday they channeled that energy, causing the Panthers to false start a whopping 8 times, most in the NFL since 2011. This severely hurt the Panthers chances of getting back into the game late in the second half, as they had one series where they had 3 false starts within the span of 2-3 minutes, essentially stopping their drive and forcing them to punt at a time where the Seahawks had all the momentum.

**Devon Witherspoon**

The 5th overall pick out of the 2023 NFL Draft had missed most of the offseason with a nagging hamstring injury, but after starting for the 2nd time in his young career, Witherspoon was targeted 19 times and only allowed 7 catches. Opposing teams know that, as a rookie, Witherspoon should be targeted the most until he gets accustomed to the speed of the NFL, and the Panthers showed that. While he has given up a touchdown in each of his starts, he only allowed 7.4 yards per completion, a far better number than his in the previous week of 21.3. Witherspoon allowed 52 yards and a strong 36.8% completion percentage allowed, a number that can be even more lower as the season progressed. Witherspoon was a consistent piece for the Seahawks secondary after Tre Brown left early in the game, prompting CB Michael Jackson Sr. to enter the game. Witherspoon has played promisingly and will only get better.
