The Seattle Seahawks have been known to specialize in the cover-3 scheme on defense under Pete Carroll. Carroll has preferred lengthy, built corners over shorter ones for most of his tenure. While 2021's draft proved different, 2022's reassured our beliefs. As of now, the Seahawks have Tariq "Avatar" Woolen as their best corner match for their cover-3 scheme, but only have Michael Jackson Sr. opposite of him. While Jackson is a solid corner, Seattle isn't obligated to him in anyways and could opt to draft a corner that fits the mold of a corner in their traditional scheme. The following are multiple cover-3 corners that Seattle could target in the 2023 NFL Draft.

**Rejzohn Wright: CB**

Overview:

The brother of Dallas Cowboys cornerback Nahshon Wright. The "Last Chance U" alum comes from East Palo Alto, California. Wright was a 3-star rated player at junior college school Laney College. He came to Oregon State in 2020 and started 24 games in total. In his final season, he recorded 2 interceptions and 9 pass breakups to go along with a first- All PAC-12 nomination.

Strengths:

Wright brings the desired size and length that NFL teams crave. His great length plays to his physical play style in press-man coverage. He's able to use that length to jam receivers at the line and disrupt the timing of the route. As a press corner, he showcases great instincts and body control to keep up with routes in spite of his lack of athletic abilities. Wright plays with great technique and solid footwork, with his longer strides allowing him to stay on top of even twitchier receivers. He also brings some versatility as a zone corner. Wright displays great awareness of his designated assignment, allowing him to drift into passing lanes whenever they cross into his territory. He shows great ball skills at the catch point or when playing off the line. He does a good job of locating the ball in the air and putting himself in the best position to make a play on it.

Shortcomings:

Similar to his brother, Wright is a pretty subpar athlete. He lacks fluidity in his hips and his explosiveness, agility, and speed are all at or below average. While he did good work against more athletic receivers in college, it is not wise to expect the same in the NFL. Savvy route runners will be able to expose his subpar functional athleticism. When he faced these types of receivers in college he tended to get grabby when they got a step on him. He'll have to tone this down in the league to avoid drawing penalties. He will be far better off covering bigger possession/contested-catch receivers when he first gets in the league. In off-coverage, Wright has room to improve his ability to recognize routes with more urgency. Another flaw in Wright's game is his run defense. He struggles to work through blocks and fails to consistently wrap up when tackling.

**Cory Trice: CB**

Overview:

Trice is a native of Hopkinsville, Kentucky, and came to Purdue as a 3-star recruit. He started games for the Boilermakers in 2019 and 2020, but unfortunately, his 2021 season was cut short by an ACL tear. Trice was able to come back for the majority of games in 2022, logging 10 pass breakups and 2 interceptions.

Strengths:

The main thing that will attract NFL teams to Trice is his size. His height and length are great by themselves, but Trice also carries a good amount of weight on his big frame. Trice should prove to be a solid press corner in the league with these tools. On tape, he is consistently using his length to disrupt his assignment off the snap. His long strides allow him to stay in phase with the receiver and not allow any initial separation. Trice plays with good physicality throughout the route and displays good ball skills at the catch point. He also brings some versatility to his game, as he shows good processing ability and awareness when playing off the line in zone coverage. Another point of strength for Trice is his contributions as a run defender. He can quickly diagnose where the play is going and is great at wrapping up once he gets the ball carrier in his grasp.

Shortcomings:

Trice isn't a great athlete on tape, and it shows when he has to cover twitchier assignments. His hips look pretty stiff in transition and he lacks the burst or long speed to stick with some of these NFL receivers. He can improve his fluidity and closing ability by working on sinking his hips and playing less upright. But to become a serviceable starter in the league, Trice will have to work on his press technique and improve his route anticipation when mirroring receivers. His hand technique and body coordination in particular are some things that need to be cleaned up in order for Trice to reach his potential as a press corner.

**Carrington Valentine: CB**

Overview

Born in Cincinnati, Valentine played as a receiver for 3 years in high school before switching to cornerback. At Kentucky, Valentine became a regular starter during his sophomore year. During his junior season, he recorded 1 interception and 10 pass breakups. Valentine was elected as a representative for UK football on the Student-Athlete Advisory Committee and earned multiple academic honor roll nominations.

Strengths:

Valentine has some tantalizing traits that are sure to excite NFL teams. He's got some nice burst off the snap to where he can immediately mirror his assignment. His above-average vertical speed lets him stick with faster receivers downfield. He's got a good-sized frame, solid length, and he plays a physical brand of football, making him an interesting prospect for teams in need of a press corner on the outside. On the other hand, Valentine displays great instincts in anticipating incoming routes when playing off the line in man or zone coverage. His backpedal is smooth and his fluid hips allow him to transition easily into a full run or a downhill drive when necessary.

Shortcomings:

For as much upside as Valentine has in coverage, he is held back by his inability as a run defender. Valentine is a subpar athlete in space, and he is often slow to diagnose plays, leading to bad angles and big runs. Valentine also needs to clean up his tackling form, as you will often see him diving for the ball-carriers legs instead of wrapping up. Other things that will also require more polish include his press technique and footwork. It would also benefit him to improve his play strength, as he currently gets outmuscled by bigger receivers during routes and when trying to get off blocks. And while he is a really physical player, Valentine can often get too handsy with receivers, which he will be called for in the NFL.

**Terell Smith: CB**

Overview

Smith was a track star in high school along with being a 4-star recruit. He won the Georgia state championship in the 100 meter (10.32) as a junior and the 200 meter (21.26) as a sophomore. He made an instant impact at Minnesota, starting nine games as a freshman. He logged 5 PBUs in 2022 to go along with 2 interceptions. Smith was also chosen for the East-West Shrine Bowl following the season.

Strengths:

With his track background, most could infer that Smith has the vertical smith to stick to faster receivers. His other tools include an ideal frame with good size and length. Smith does a good job of using his length to disrupt the timing of routes. But instead of doing this in press coverage, Smith is better suited to playing off coverage and jamming receivers near the stem of their route. He's a high-IQ zone player with great awareness. Smith can anticipate routes as they near the stem and transition from his pedal to mirror the receiver upfield. His overall footwork in his pedal and in transition is clean, allowing him very little wasted movement. Smith shows good physicality at the catch point and has the ball skills to consistently put himself in a position to make plays. As a tackler, Smith does a good job of wrapping up the runner and finishing the play off strong.

Shortcomings

Even with the other tools that would make him the ideal press corner, Smith fits better in off-coverage because he lacks the twitch and change of direction to consistently mirror an NFL route tree. He's also fairly average as an athlete in terms of his hip fluidity and lateral agility. And while Smith already shows decent closing speed, he can be a better downhill player if he works on fully sinking his hips to help him better explode from his previous stance. Smith can work on his play as a run defender. He needs to become more aggressive when fighting through blocks and improve on his play strength. Improving his play strength will also help him with effectively jamming larger assignments so that he can hand fight without being outmuscled entirely.
