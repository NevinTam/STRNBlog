        Seahawks Today Lead Writers: Shrihun Sankepally and Nevin Tamilselvan

In the past two weeks, the Seahawks have had an explosion across the defensive line, with an incredible amount of pressure put on opposing quarterbacks Justin Herbert and Kyler Murray. This pressure has been mostly on the interior, which has come from simplifying the defensive scheme, allowing the pass rushers to rush the QB first and not have to react to the offense. This, combined with changes in the edge rotation, has led to a revitalization of the Seahawks defense.

**IDL Poona Ford**

After being stagnant for much of the first part of the season, Ford broke out in a big way in the Seahawk's week 6 matchup with the Cardinals. In that game, Ford had 5 tackles, 3 TFLs, 1 sack, and 1 pass deflection. This game had Ford excelling in all parts of a defensive lineman, making it tough for the Cardinals to move the ball consistently with an ineffective rushing attack outside of QB Kyler Murray. In the Chargers game in Week 7, Ford did not have quite the dominant performance but had a key run stop on Chargers RB Austin Ekeler while plugging gaps in the run game, limiting Chargers RBs to 31 yards off 12 carries. Ford has overall been inconsistent as a pass rusher throughout his NFL tenure but has shown increasing flashes in the past two seasons after making the switch to a three-technique defensive tackle, making it interesting to see if he can continue this run of good play throughout the rest of the season.

**OLB Darrell Taylor**

Darrell Taylor, similarly to Ford, was expected to have an increased role this season after showing many flashes in his "rookie" season in 2021. In the season opener, he recorded 4 pressures against the Broncos but struggled in run defense, allowing Broncos TE Andrew Beck to gain 25 yards on what could have been a stop for no gain. This trend of poor run defense continued in Week 2 against the Niners, where Taylor allowed 49ers, WR Deebo Samuel, to get free for a 51-yard rush when he had an opportunity to bring him down in the backfield. Similar performances were found in games against the Falcons with Cordarelle Patterson, Lions with Jamaal Williams, and the Saints with Alvin Kamara and Taysom Hill. This led to 2nd-round rookie Boye Mafe taking Taylor's starting role and relegating Taylor to a more situational pass-rusher, allowing Mafe to play on early downs and Taylor on passing downs. In the past two weeks, the change seems to have worked great, as Taylor has recorded sacks and FFs in back-to-back weeks and has also reinvigorated his pass-rushing, which went dormant after his explosive week 1. He's recorded 5 pressures and 2 sacks within the last two weeks while playing an average of 48% of snaps during that stretch. If the Seahawks allow him to rush the passer more while limiting his drawbacks in the run game, they will be able to keep consistent outside pressure on the quarterback as they have done in the past two weeks.

**IDL Quinton Jefferson**

Signing back to the Seahawks after a 3-year break, Jefferson has slowly emerged as a quality pass-rushing piece on this new revamped defensive line. Quinton has repeatedly beaten his block, always putting himself in the right place to make a play. While his pressures in recent times are largely similar to the earlier weeks, that is not the main reason why he has been a crucial part of a re-energized defense. Jefferson can shed his block and affect the run game a lot more now, than his earlier weeks. Quinton, since the revamp, has recorded 8 tackles in 3 weeks, with 2 of them being tackles for loss. For reference, in weeks 1-5, he only had 1 TFL. His sacks have also taken a slight boost, recording 1 sack during weeks 1-5, but 1 each in weeks 6 and 7. Overall, Jefferson, in recent weeks, has gotten a lot better at disrupting the play, whether it be taking down the quarterback, tackling the ball carrier for a short gain, or even for a tackle for loss, providing one of the pieces the Seahawks have needed to play well on defense in recent weeks.

**IDL Shelby Harris**

Acquired in the blockbuster Russell Wilson trade, Harris made an immediate impact in his first game against his former team, the Broncos. In that game, he had 3 tackles, 1 TFL, 1 QB hit, and 2 pressures. Following this performance was quiet for the next following weeks as he fought through injuries, but recently has had a resurgence along with the rest of the defensive line. He has had 1 sack, 6 tackles, 2 pressures, and 2 TFLs while playing in a rotational role with other players such as Poona Ford and Quinton Jefferson. Harris's value as a defensive lineman goes further than that, as he has been dominant in batted passes, so far having 25 in 5 seasons with the Broncos and again on the pace for 5 this season. Being a disruptor in the trenches has been a big part of the Seahawk's defensive resurgence, and will again be needed if the Seahawks intend to make a push for the playoffs.

**OLB Uchenna Nwosu**

After spending his 4-year rookie contract with the Chargers, Nwosu signed on with the Seahawks for a 2-year, $20 million contract. Posting 5 sacks with the Chargers, the 25-year-old was expected to have a strong season as the secondary EDGE rusher behind Darrell Taylor. But, as the season has progressed, Nwosu has usurped Taylor as the primary EDGE playing nearly 80% of all defensive snaps per game. Part of that may be Taylor's struggles, but it is mainly Nwosu's ever-growing success and achievements. He has quietly emerged as a successful EDGE rusher, on track to post 70 tackles, 7 sacks, 10 TFLs, 24 QB hits, and 2 Forced Fumbles, all career highs for the young pass rusher. At the beginning of the season, while posting similar sacks, has been all the more disruptive in recent weeks as he has made an impact that does not always show up on the stat sheet. Since week 6, Nwosu has posted a TFL in each game, compared to just 2 in five weeks. His impact that does not show up on the stat line is his ability to draw attention on pass-rushing downs, making offensive coordinators scheme two linemen to block him, allowing for other rushers to make the statistically big play. Even though Nwosu's numbers have been similar throughout each week, in recent weeks his impact has helped turn around the defensive line by taking on more double teams, allowing for others to play freely, and in return, succeed.
