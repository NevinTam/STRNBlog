**RB Kenneth Walker III**

As a second-round rookie from last year, Kenneth Walker emerged onto the scene after an unfortunate Rashaad Penny injury early in the year. Walker had his ups and downs during the season but concluded as a 1000-yard rookie rusher, something only one other rookie running back was able to do last year. Walker enters his second year as the clear #1 running back for the Seattle Seahawks, with nothing in his way to stop him from improving to a 1300+ yard running back. While the Seahawks did add rookie running backs to the room, contrary to other beliefs, in our eyes these running backs will improve Walker's production by providing relief for him on certain downs, allowing a rejuvenated Walker to break out against an exhausted defense. The Seahawks will have a much improved offensive line from their year prior, allowing Walker to truly showcase his bell-cow juke special abilities for the first time in his young NFL career. Walker's production will skyrocket with a better offensive line and more running backs able to provide relief for him, ultimately justifying Seattle's cost of a second-round pick on him.

**RB Zach Charbonnet**

As a late second-round pick in the 2023 NFL Draft, Zach Charbonnet was the second running back the Seahawks picked on Day 2 of the NFL Draft in the last 2 years. Charbonnet has provided similarities to Chris Carson during both his time in the NFL Draft process as well as a rookie participating in Seattle's offseason activities. Zach is a strong pass-catcher that can run strong routes and catch the ball out of the backfield. Charbonnet is a power back that may not always get the big play but can get that extra 1 or 2 yards by running straight through the pile instead of avoiding it. The Seahawks needed to spend a pick on a power back as evidenced by last year, Walker prefers to take the ball outside and beat the defense with his speed, rather than take it up the middle to get the necessary yards. With Walker's limitations, Charbonnet provides the missing element to Seattle's offense as a power back that will take the ball straight up the gut and a running back who can provide relief for Walker and reduce the fatigue and wear and tear on Seattle's #1 RB to diversify their offense and keep each RB fresh. Charbonnet will be the change of pace running back Seattle has longed for that will beat up defenses with brute force and allow Walker to play towards his specialties of taking the ball outside and beating a defense with his speed.

**RB DeeJay Dallas**

Dallas has been the Seahawks' 3rd or 4th RB on the depth chart since his time as a rookie, and this season provides no difference to his role in Seattle's offense. DeeJay has been a decent change of pace back within the confines of his limited role, and likely will not move from there in the 2023 season. As Travis Homer succumbed to injury last season, Dallas stepped in as the Seahawks' 3rd down back and played well enough for him to be in consideration as the 3rd down back, but not well enough for Dallas to be the only option Seattle has on 3rd down. Charbonnet's pass-catching prowess automatically puts him above Dallas as well as Kenny McIntosh's pass-blocking skills push Dallas only above Walker on 3rd down. Dallas will most likely play heavily in the preseason as well as compete with McIntosh to be featured as the 3rd running back on the depth chart and compete with Kenny and Zach for the 3rd down responsibilities. DeeJay will be a free agent in the year following meaning this contract year for Dallas may be the deciding factor as to whether Seattle decides to bring him back. Dallas is mediocre-enough at all the responsibilities of Seattle's running backs on any down with his average pass-blocking, making him a unique proposition for Seattle's offense as a relief back for any of Seattle's other running backs with intricate skillsets.

**RB Kenny McIntosh**

Seattle's seventh-round draft pick from the 2023 NFL Draft was predicted to go in the 3rd round but with a generational fall, McIntosh ended up in Seattle with their last pick of the draft. McIntosh could end up being one of Seattle's steals in the draft this year as with his skillset there should have been no reason he fell past pick 200. McIntosh enters the Seattle RB room as the best pass-blocker among the four, and it isn't particularly close. He also is the best pass-catching back with his knack to see the open holes with the ball in his hand and be able to accelerate toward the gap with his top-tier vision and movement. The Seahawks have a wide open gap for their 3rd down running back spot between Charbonnet, Dallas, and McIntosh, and McIntosh may prove his worth as a 7th-round draft pick and win the spot from day Day 1. While Dallas remains in the competition, the duel is mainly between Seattle's two rookie running backs. McIntosh has all the tools and traits to win the job and prove his worth over Charbonnet for 3rd down, who will most likely be the 1b for Walker on 1st and 2nd downs, allowing the 3rd down role to be McIntosh's for taking. With McIntosh having a chance to be the 3rd down back, and Charbonnet and Walker expected to both be RB1s for the season, Seattle's running back room might be dominated by a young 7th-round rookie with all the potential and two 2nd-round RBs of the past 2 years to provide Seattle with one of the best running back trifectas in the NFL.
