Darrell Taylor has quietly become a start-studded pass rusher after being benched for 32-year-old Bruce Irvin. Recording 7.5 sacks in the last 10 games he has played, Taylor has officially removed Irvin from the starting EDGE role, out snapping him 43 to 11. Taylor has also been the team's clear EDGE #1 as Nwosu has been largely ineffective as a pass rusher in recent weeks, compared to the early season in which he was a menace to opposing offensive linemen. While Nwosu still has recorded pressures, he had recorded 2 in the Jets game, he hasn't recorded a sack in 4 straight games playing as a starter.

As stated by Pete Carroll, Taylor initially was attempting to use a wide variety of pass rush moves on opposing offensive tackles, ones he wasn't extremely skilled at, which resulted in ineffective and inconsistent play, and the signing of Bruce Irvin. Irvin and Nwosu remained a starter alongside Irvin who both at times played over 40 and 50 snaps a game, reducing Taylor's snaps played to under 28 for 6 straight games. While Taylor was able to amass 3 forced fumbles in the first 7 games of the season, he was limited as a pass rusher and was not able to record any turnovers during his 6 games of having a limited role.

In the first 7 games of the season, Taylor was able to get 11 pressures, for an average of 1.6 pressures per game. In the next 7 games he played as mainly a backup for 6 of them, he got 8 pressures, or 1.1 pressures a game. For reference, Uchenna Nwosu in his first 7 games of the season amassed 10 pressures, or 1.4 pressures a game. In the remainder of the season, knowing he has played every game of the season, while Taylor completely missed week 9 and only played 3 snaps in week 8 due to an injury, Nwosu totaled 14 pressures in 9 games, for an average of 1.55 pressures a game. In comparison, Taylor averaged 0.2 more pressures a game than Nwosu in the first 7 weeks, and while playing at times 64% fewer snaps a game than Nwosu, still averaged 0.45 pressures less than Nwosu, even when playing as a clear backup for all but one game and he was injured and missed a full game and 62 more snaps in the previous one.

To statistically factor the missed snaps into the debrief we can see pressures per snap played for Nwosu and Taylor individually. We can see as both players being starters in the earlier weeks, Taylor was more efficient as a pass rusher, edging Nwosu by .2 pressures a game, but we can use the snap count metric to find out efficiency when Taylor was a backup and rotational player. From weeks 8 to 17 Uchenna Nwosu Jr. played 470 snaps and accumulated 14 pressures, or 34 snaps a pressure. In those same weeks, Darrell Taylor recorded 161 snaps on defense and pressured opposing quarterbacks 8 times, for 20 snaps per pressure. While you can argue Nwosu played majority of the game during those weeks and was on the field on both run and pass downs he may have been exhausted, and Taylor was only on select pass downs and rarely ever run downs, which kept him fresh, out of pure numbers alone Taylor was more efficient with his snaps in pressuring the offense's quarterback.
