**Round 1, Pick 5 - DT Jalen Carter (Georgia)**

Jalen Carter is one of the top prospects in the 2023 draft, finishing a monster season with one of the top defenses in College Football with the Georgia Bulldogs. Carter was the leader of a defensive front that repeatedly harassed even the best of offensive lines in the SEC. The Seahawks currently have a big hole in their defensive line after releasing much of their interior defensive line following a below-average season against the run and generating pressure from the interior. Since then, the Seahawks have signed Dre'Mont Jones to a massive 3-year $54 million dollar deal, who could pair nicely with Carter on the inside to really establish the Seahawks as a threat on the interior for the first time in a decade. If the Seahawks have Dre'Mont Jones, Jalen Carter, and Jarran Reed as their DE rotation, their defensive line may quickly turn into of their strongest positions on the team.

**Round 1, Pick 20 - WR Zay Flowers (Boston College)**

Zay Flowers is a speedy receiver from Boston College who is great with the ball in his hands and excellent at deep-route running, drawing comparisons to Seahawks WR Tyler Lockett when he entered the league. Flowers would fill a pressing need at the WR3 position for the Seahawks, who have not resigned last year's WR3 Marquise Goodwin. As of now, Dee Eskridge and Dareke Young would be competing for the Seahawks WR3 spot, but Eskridge while he has potential, is not available in times of need. Young played well alongside Cade Johnson in the closing weeks of the 2022 season but going into the season with him as your WR3 would be a recipe for disaster. Expect Flowers to step in as the team's 3rd receiving option, giving the Seahawks an elite receiving group headlined by DK Metcalf, Tyler Lockett, Noah Fant, and the new Zay Flowers.

**Round 2, Pick 37 - DT Mazi Smith (Michigan)**

Mazi Smith is a monster NT sitting at 6'3 323 lbs and is extremely athletic and already is good at stopping the run, something the Seahawks struggled with last year. Smith could improve on making plays in the backfield, such as generating pressure or getting big TFLs by shedding blocks quickly. The Seahawks could use Smith on the interior of their defensive line after releasing NT Al Woods, which would provide the Seahawks with a new starter alongside the defensive line for years to come. Bryan Mone is coming off an ACL tear meaning Mazi would be the only healthy NT come week 1. Mazi is the clear best-nose tackle in this draft and can eat up blocks and dominate the run game while providing a boost in the pass-rush element of the defensive line. Mazi could pair up with Jones and Carter and with the entire defensive line starters being young, they could form an elite trio of star-studded pass rushers and run defenders in the coming years.

**Round 2, Pick 52 - OG Cody Mauch (North Dakota State)**

Cody Mauch has played tackle for the majority of his career in college but with the transition to the NFL is expected to be moved to Guard, where he can utilize his abilities of speed and move to the second level more often to create rushing lanes. Mauch would compete with guard Phil Haynes for the RG spot after the Seahawks released Gabe Jackson earlier this offseason. Mauch could emerge as the starter at right guard as soon as the season starts if he impresses in training camp, but if not he can slowly be eased into the league by Phil Haynes. With Charles Cross, Damien Lewis, Evan Brown, and Abraham Lucas expected to be the starters beside Mauch, the Seahawks would have turned their offensive line from the cheap veteran mess it was in years past to a young group filled with potential for years to come.

**Round 3, Pick 83 - LB Daiyan Henley (Washington State)**

Daiyan Henley has shown good coverage skills as a linebacker at Washington State, which is a treasured skill for linebackers as the NFL becomes more and more passing-driven. Henley would become an immediate LB2 behind Bobby Wagner after the injury to Jordyn Brooks that will likely not heal until the end of the season. Henley could be the coverage linebacker that would allow Wagner to play more toward the run, a skill that he has been the best at for the last decade. If Brooks were to make an appearance at the end of the year, Henley could also complement him and be the coverage linebacker Brooks needs to gear toward his strengths in run defending which was the main reason the Seahawks drafted him. To start the season, expect Bush and Wagner to play beside each other and for Henley to win the job over Bush as the season progresses. Or, if Seattle continues to do what they have done in recent years, Henley may start day 1 over Bush, and push through the growing pains as the season continues.

**Trade! Cleveland Browns get Pick 4.123 and 5.151, Seahawks get 4.126 and 5.140**

**Round 4, Pick 126 - RB Tyjae Spears (Tulane)**

Spears is a versatile running back who has great speed and can make plays with the ball in his hands, demonstrating his great elusiveness and breakaway speed, similar to Seahawks RB Kenneth Walker but to a somewhat lesser degree. The Seahawks could use Spears after they lost RB Travis Homer and RB Rashaad Penny in free agency, leaving them with currently only 1 backup running back in DeeJay Dallas, who only has one year left on his rookie contract. Tyjae Spears is not known for his pass-catching, but if he were to emerge as a running back with capable hands, he has the potential to end up as the 3rd down RB complement to Ken Walker who would be the lead horseback on first and second downs. If Spears does not become a 3rd down RB, the Seahawks will have a sure-fire depth piece that can bring Kenneth Walker's element of the game whenever needed, whether it be a simple rest of the sideline for Walker to catch his breath or an injury to Seattle's lead workhorse. Spears will most likely never surpass Walker on the depth if both are healthy, but does not need to be for Seattle and can be eased into the NFL with limited snaps each game to accustom him to the professional level.

**Round 5, Pick 140 - EDGE Isaiah McGuire (Missouri)**

McGuire enjoyed a productive career at Missouri where he had 2 seasons of double-digit tackles for loss, demonstrating his ability to set the edge and stop the run when needed. Seahawks struggled to set the edge with their edges in 2022, becoming a consistent problem that contributed to a struggling Seahawks run defense throughout the season. The Seahawks drafted Tyreke Smith in the 5th round last year, but after a hip injury sidelined him for the whole year, the Seahawks realized they needed a 4th edge as Alton Robinson also never played a snap, leading to Bruce Irvin being signed in the middle of the season. The Seahawks hope to enter this season in stark contrast to how they entered last season as they would want more EDGEs than less to avoid the problem they faced last year. Uchenna Nwosu and Darrell Taylor are the clear starters with Boye Mafe, one of two second-round picks from last year, will hope to throw off the "raw" label and emerge as a pass rush threat. This leaves EDGE4 and potentially EDGE5 open on Seattle's roster for the likes of McGuire, Alton Robinson, Tyreke Smith, and maybe a new veteran addition such as Bruce Irvin to compete to win the final 2 roster spots. McGuire has all the potential to win the job but will need to have a strong training camp to win it over veteran Alton Robinson and perhaps Bruce Irvin if he is added to the roster and 2nd-year player Tyreke Smith who will be viewed as a rookie in the competition as he never played a down last year.

**Round 5, Pick 154 - CB Mekhi Gardner (LSU)**

Gardner is a cornerback that fits the typical mold of a Pete Caroll Seahawks corner: tall frame with long arms and fast speed. The Seahawks have often been attracted to such prospects, most recently drafting Tariq Woolen in the 5th round last season. The Seahawks could use Gardner as a backup or have him possibly compete for the 2nd outside corner spot alongside Tariq Woolen. Gardner would compete with Michael Jackson Sr if he were to contend for the second cornerback spot. Jackson may not let go of the job easily as he played at an above-average level over the course of the 2022 season, but if the Seahawks wanted to see Gardner perform, they may throw him onto the field during the first game and see if he can hold his ground. This "trial" for Gardner would be on par with what the Seahawks have done in recent years, and if Gardner holds up at the spot Seattle may keep him there for the rest of the season knowing they have a very lengthy cornerback duo that Pete Carroll always strives to have.

**Round 6, Pick 198 - C Juice Scruggs (Penn State)**

Scruggs is a center from Penn State who had a great 2022 season at center. He can also play right guard, which he did partly in 2021 and is very athletic, which is important for the Seahawks zone rushing scheme that requires fast centers to move defensive tackles. If drafted, Scruggs would compete with recently signed Evan Brown for the starting center position and could provide a long-term solution for center if Brown leaves for free agency next offseason.

**Round 7, Pick 237 - RB Evan Hull (Northwestern)**

Evan Hull is the 2nd RB the Seahawks will be taking and has strong abilities as a 3rd-down back, with a great recieving back skill-set. He runs with power and breaks-tackles after securing the ball, making him a useful power back that the Seahawks are lacking. However, Hull is not great at pass-blocking, something he will have to improve at during his rookie year. Hull would fit into the Seahawks after they lost their previous 3rd down back in Travis Homer in free agency.
