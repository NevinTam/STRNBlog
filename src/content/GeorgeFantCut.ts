After signing a 2-year contract with the Seattle Seahawks in his second stint with the team, offensive tackle George Fant was cut after 1 year. Signing a $9 million contract, Fant played 30 snaps in two separate games. He also had two separate stints on the injured reserved list, including one that ended his season. When John Schneider and the Seattle Seahawks front office signed George Fant to the team it appeared that he would be a safety option as Abraham Lucas nursed his way back from an injury. However, Fant battled many injuries and the Seahawks were left starting their RT3 and even RT4 throughout the season. The team's depth at right tackle became so limited that they signed Jason Peters to the practice squad: who recently retired and joined the Seahawks in a leadership role. As the Seahawks approach the 2025 NFL off-season what they do at the right tackle position in terms of who they start and their depth pieces will be key for a team that is trying to turn around their offensive line.

With playing just 30 snaps and going on injured reserve twice including not being activated before the season ended, George Fant's future in the NFL is uncertain as he attempts to recover from his injuries and approaches age 33. Fant will always be remembered more for his time in Seattle during his first stint with the team. The Seahawks saved $3.8 million with this cut and take on $1.85 million in dead cap money. With major holes all over the offensive line including at starting and depth positions, what the Seahawks do to address their biggest flaw may determine their success in the 2025 NFL season. While the idea of signing Fant to be a reserve option for the Seahawks at tackle is good, it appears the Seahawks may need to go another direction for depth in 2025, perhaps with another veteran player.
