**Offense**

The offense flatlined once again against the 49ers. The run game never got going. Geno Smith threw a bad interception to the sideline. The Seahawks had almost no offensive yards entering the 2nd half. The Seahawks four main pass catchers DK Metcalf, Tyler Lockett, Jaxon Smith-Njigba, and Noah Fant were all held to under 42 receiving yards. JSN led the charge with 41 yards on 2 receptions, including a potential catch-of-the-year candidate with a one-handed reception. Geno Smith was efficient besides the interception, posting a 67% completion percentage and 180 yards. However, while the play-calling has been lackluster in recent weeks, Smith also missed wide-open receivers mainly across the middle. He may be missing receivers across the middle due to many of the Seahawks routes in the last few games not having routes across the middle: credited to Shane Waldron's play-calling.

**Zach Charbonnet**

Charbonnet played well but was not Ken Walker. Walker is the clear starter for this team and will stay like that at least until the season ends. Charbonnet averaged 3.4 yards per carry and totaled 47 yards on the ground. He had 4 receptions on the ground for 11 yards. Charbonnet tripped Geno Smith early in the game on a play-action call and almost led Geno Smith into their own endzone for a safety. Other than that rookie mistake, which was extremely detrimental on an offensive drive that happened while the Seahawks were still in the game, Charbonnet played well in his first-ever career start. With a full week of preparation, Charbonnet should play well against the Cowboys, who also have a vaunted front-7, during Thursday Night Football.

**Tariq Woolen**

Woolen was one of the best stories out of the NFL in 2022. Coming out as a 5th-round rookie, Woolen led the NFL in interceptions with 6. With a season like that in 2022, the sky was the limit for Woolen. And while he has been even better in coverage this season, the interceptions have not been there as much, largely due to dropped interceptions as well as fewer opportunities. But a much larger problem has emerged in recent weeks, leading to Woolen being benched early in the game for CB Michael Jackson Sr.. Woolen was benched due to his tackling, something that has been an issue for the entire year but was mainly prevalent against the 49ers, including a play where he knocked Tre Brown out of the tackle and allowed the 49ers' WR to reach the 1st down on a crucial 3rd down. Carroll believed Woolen's tackling problems were due to his shoulder injury, and while that may be true and may have made the problem worse than manageable, Woolen was not an exceptional tackler earlier in the season before the game.

**Leonard Williams**

Leonard Williams was one of the few players during this game who were playmakers on defense. Williams made a crucial stop early in the game, getting in the backfield and stopping a screen right in its tracks a few yards short of the line of scrimmage. He was also continuously in the backfield, recording 7 pressures according to PFF. While the Seahawks only have 1 win in 4 games since his arrival in Seattle, Williams has been a star throughout the game. Williams will be a key piece for the Seahawks if they want to make a push for the playoffs in the last stretch of the season, but the team needs to reflect his effort by starting to accumulate wins. Williams will make the other defensive linemen around him better every time he is on the field and should not be faulted for the Seahawks recent losses, including their most recent loss against the 49ers.
