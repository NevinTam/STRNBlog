**A'Shawn Robinson**

A'Shawn Robinson was drafted by the Lions in the second round of the 2016 draft, and played out his entire contract with the Lions before signing with the Los Angeles Rams in 2020. Robinson is a veteran run defender that plugged holes in the run game alongside Aaron Donald for the past several years, including their Super Bowl run in 2021. However, in 2022, Robinson suffered injuries forcing him to miss 7 games. While being a good run defender, Robinson struggled as a pass rusher, only gettiing 5 pressures in 2022. The Seahawks may sign him if they lose Poona Ford or have to cut Shelby Harris and use him as more of a rotational lineman to stop the run.

**Contract Estimate:**2 years, $15 million

**Should the Seahawks sign:**No, as Robinson is at an older part of his career at the moment and the Seahawks could use more youth in the defensive line. They also need to get more pass-rushing talent on the defensive line, as that was a key issue during the 2022 season. The easiest way to address this is to draft players on the defensive line during the draft.

**Larry Ogunjobi**

Larry Ogunjobi was drafted by the Browns in the 3rd round of the 2017 draft. He played out his entire contract and was then signed by the Bengals in 2021 before they went on their Super Bowl run. During this year, he had a career year, totaling 7 sacks and 16 QB hits. Following the run, he was about to get a major 3 year, $40 million deal from the Bears before a failed physical lost him that deal. He then signed with the Steelers for 1 year $8 million. In Pittsburg, Ogunjobi suffered several injuries late in the season but still had 1.5 sacks and 11 QB hits. Ogunjobi could provide the pass-rushing force the Seahawks are looking for on the interior for a cheap price.

**Contract Estimate:**2 years, $11 million

**Should the Seahawks Sign:**If the Seahawks to focus more on the LB and OL positions in the earlier rounds, I think they could sign Ogunjobi to give more life to the interior pass-rush which has been lacking in Seattle for years.

**Arden Key**

Arden Key was drafted by the Raiders in the 3rd round and was released after 3 years into his contract. He was then signed by the 49ers where he had a career year, totalling 6.5 sacks and 17 QB hits. He signed another one year, this time with the Jaguars, where he put up good numbers playing at times out of his position due to injuries. Key has been primarily a depth piece that has been able to produce as a pass rusher, which would be extremely valuable for a struggling Seahawks pass rush.

**Contract Estimate:** 1 year, $5 million

**Should the Seahawks Sign:**The Seahawks should sign Key because he would provide valuable depth that could be versatile while providing consistent pressure as a depth player, allowing other players to also thrive.
