Seahawks Today Lead Writers: Shrihun Sankepally and Nevin Tamilselvan

The Draft:

For the first 4 picks, we decided to manually do some trades to simulate how the draft order may play out come April 27th.   

1.1 Carolina Panthers - Bryce Young

1.2 Houston Texans - CJ Stroud

1.3 Arizona Cardinals - Will Anderson Jr.

1.4 Colts - Anthony Richardson



**Jalen Carter - IDL - Georgia - Pick 1.5:**

The Seahawks have been lacking a game-wrecking presence on the team for quite some time, and Carter may just be able to solve that issue. Everyone is well aware of his explosiveness off the line and his ability to power through blockers with his length and lower body strength, but what makes Carter truly special from other interior D-line prospects is his hand usage. He has consistently shown that he can beat offensive linemen with a combination of different pass-rush moves and techniques. The play strength that he has shown a the collegiate level will also transfer nicely to the NFL. I expect him to be able to come in and be effective at rushing the passer and being able to plug gaps and stop the run.

I think his conditioning issues are legitimate, but I have no doubts that an NFL conditioning program can get him up to speed. In terms of his position, Carter should slot nicely into the 3-4 DE role in the Seahawk's D-line. He has demonstrated the ability to be effective while playing 3-tech and 5-tech at Georgia, and it will be a luxury to be able to move him around as the Seahawks often also utilized a 3-4 under front.   

John Schneider openly addressed the major problems on the defensive line, stating that the team struggled greatly at getting off the field due to their problems up front on defense. The Seahawks have cycled through the likes of Quinton Jefferson and Poona Ford at one DE spot, but know if Seattle wants to turn their defense around, Carter is the beast they need. While Dre'Mont Jones is able to replace Shelby Harris who was cut as one of the starters, the other one remains wide open for Carter to start from day 1 and allow Jarran Reed to play as the 3rd DE. With the hope of better coverage in the backside of the defense, improvements from the 2022 Seahawks mixed with a full showcase of talent from free agency signings are warranted for Carter to feast on opposing linemen. Even with the hopefulness, if the team can address a few of its defensive needs later on in the 2023 NFL Draft, Jalen Carter will be able to perform as a quality starter right from week 1.

**Trade**: The Seahawks felt a prospect Trenton Simpson would make it out of the 1st round so the Seahawks sent pick 1.20 to the Kansas City Chiefs for 1.31 and 2.63 to gather extra picks while making sure they still got their guy.

**Trenton Simpson - ILB - Clemson - Pick 1.31:**

The NFL Draft community seems pretty divided on Simpson, but I still think he's a great player with a great upside in the NFL. If you look at the modern-day passing game, you will see guys like Travis Kelce and Mark Andrews who are able to tear up defenses with their ability to split a defense open. Modern defenses need players like Trenton Simpson to lock down these tight ends and slot weapons. Simpson brings elite athleticism and range to the LB position, something I think the Seahawks have lacked for the past decade. His fluid hips and speed will make it possible for him to stay in the hip pockets of even the most agile tight-ends. He also brings pass rush versatility, recording 6 sacks in 2021 when Clemson played him as an edge rusher on 3rd down.

Simpson does have some weaknesses in his overall game, but he will be playing with one of the greatest players to play the position Bobby Wagner, giving him the perfect chance to better develop his game.

With Jordyn Brooks recovering from an ACL injury and being expected to miss the start of the 2023 season and Seattle signing Bobby Wagner and Devin Bush to 1-year deals, Trenton Simpson is the perfect pick in this draft. The Seahawks need someone who can start with Bobby Wagner and Devin Bush until Brooks is healthy enough that Simpson and Brooks or any of Seattle's other linebackers can create a monster duo. The Seahawks have largely needed a coverage linebacker that can prove sufficient in run defense and Simpson appears to be a perfect fit. Simpson fitting the mold of being a linebacker who can cover can allow Brooks to better utilize the tools that he was drafted for, such as finding running backs in the backfield and blowing up running plays. Trenton Simpson will automatically fit the scheme and make Brooks an above-average linebacker instantly with both linebackers being used to their strengths. As Simpson is also sufficient enough in run defense, and Brooks improved to be manageable in coverage by the end of the 2022 season, opposing offenses will not be able to run the ball the entire game or only target the middle of the field when passing because both linebackers are well-rounded enough to not be exploitable in any scenario of the game, but rather both to be played and utilized to feature their strengths. Brooks and Wagner have similar play styles and flaws, so expect Simpson to play alongside Wagner and cover up his flaws in the same way he will for Brooks later in the season.

**Mazi Smith - NT - Michigan - Pick 2.37:**

Mazi Smith was part of a stellar Michigan team that made it to the college football playoffs two years in a row. The Seahawks have a hole at nose tackle, and Smith is just the right player to fill that hole. He played in a variety of positions on the Wolverines' defensive line, but he projects to be a 1/0-tech in the league, with the ability to shift to 3-tech with his athleticism and pass rush ability.

Being listed on Feldman's freaks list is no small matter, and Smith shows that great athleticism on tape. He separates himself from other nose tackles due to the high pass-rush upside he possesses. He has the ceiling of a potential 3-down player, but before that can happen Smith has to improve himself as a gap-stuffing run defender. The Seahawks can help him out in this regard by signing a veteran nose tackle (Al Woods or Poona Ford) to help share snaps with Smith.

The Seahawks cut Al Woods, have not resigned Poona Ford, and have Bryan Mone who is recovering from an ACL tear. In other words, nose tackle is the direst position for the team. Poona Ford could be resigned and be switched to the nose, his most natural position, but entering a few weeks before the draft that has not been the case. Al Woods could also be resigned, but is not a starter at this age and would be subbing in for Mazi for up to 15 snaps a game. Mazi would be the centerpiece to a revamped defensive front that would now have Jalen Carter, Jarran Reed, Mazi Smith, Dre'Mont Jones, and Myles Adams, creating a deep rotation to maximize pass rush talents and not exhaust a single piece of their core. Mazi has pass-rush upside, something Seattle has not seen out of the nose tackle position in the slightest, but with Mazi, he can win his double teams and provide the needed boost to a historically dormant pass rush in recent years.

**Josh Downs - WR - North Carolina - Pick 2.52**

Adding a YAC monster as a WR3 could go a long way in helping the Seahawks' offense in becoming a consistent top 5 offense in the NFL. Downs is a twitched-up athlete that is as fluid as it gets as a route runner. His ability to be a zone coverage beater in the slot gives both Metcalf and Lockett more opportunities to beat defenses further down the field. While his smaller frame may be a bit concerning, Downs has the speed and agility to create separation regardless of who he's up against. The addition of Downs also sets the Seahawks up well for the future. When Tyler Lockett leaves, the Seahawks shouldn't have to look far for a WR2 with Downs on the team.

After drafting D'Wayne Eskridge in the 2nd round to complement DK Metcalf and Tyler Lockett, the Seahawks still need a 3rd WR. Eskridge has yet to emerge, leading to Downs being drafted with Seattle's original 2nd round pick. Downs is the perfect WR for a team that has gone into every offseason of the last half-decade needing a good WR3. Downs will alleviate double teams from Lockett, and more often Metcalf, as defenses will need to respect the Seahawks' 3rd option, allowing the Seahawks' main 2 receivers to get open more frequently. DK was one of the most doubled receivers in all of 2022 and his production expectedly dipped, but with Downs on the field, DK should keep growing as a player and improve off his season two years and get 1500+ yards. DK Metcalf and Tyler Lockett will finally have a WR3 that can command attention and allow Seattle's 2 main stars to shine their brightest.

**Keanu Benton - DE - Wisconsin - Pick 2.63**

The Seahawks are still lacking some youth at the defensive end position, and Benton is the perfect player to fill that hole. Dre'Mont Jones is on the smaller side when it comes to 3-4 DEs, weighing in at 281 LBs. Benton looks to complement that on the opposite side with his big 6'3 309 LB frame and 34-inch arms. While Benton did play primarily as a 1/0 tech in college, I believe he will mainly be used as a 3-tech at the NFL level. But if needed, I think Benton could slot in at nose, if he fixes a certain issue that I will mention later.  

Here's what you'll see on tape with Benton. Playing as a nose tackle for Wisconsin, he had the chance to show off his arsenal of pass rush moves that he frequently used to go right past Big-Ten offensive linemen. He is an above-average athlete at the position, but at the senior bowl, he showcased his ability to use violently quick hands to beat linemen in 1v1s. As a run defender, Benton can work on improving his play strength and his ability to quickly anchor down and hold his gap, but he's already someone who can make big plays when given the chance. His size will give the Seahawks the option to use him to play 2 gaps, allowing for guys like Dre Jones easy access to the offensive backfield.

Keanu Benton will add depth to a defensive line group that had completely been redone this offseason, adding Dre'Mont Jones, Jarran Reed, Jalen Carter, and now Keanu Benton to its 3-4 DEs. The Seahawks need to not overplay any of their defensive lineman and a deep rotation of 5 quality players, including Myles Adams who could sub in for 5-10 snaps a game, would keep their high-end players fresh for the entire season and on a game-to-game basis. The biggest weakness for the Seahawks on defense is rooted in their defensive line, and adding talent there is necessary to make E sure in the coming years the defensive line becomes a strength and not a weakness. Players like Tariq Woolen, Coby Bryant, and Michael Jackson Sr. will improve from their strong seasons with a defensive line that will be better at defending the run and getting to the quarterback. With a defensive line that can stop the run, the Seahawks' corners are able to lessen their focus on helping defend the run and more on covering the opposition. Also, with an improved run game, Seattle will face fewer play-action concepts which will allow their corners to maintain focus on either the run or pass, rather than checking to see if a run could turn into a pass during play-action. Similarly, if Seattle's defensive line improves in reaching the quarterback Seattle's secondary will also improve as their corners will not be asked to hold up in coverage for extended amounts of time. With Seattle's corners only being needed to cover for a set duration, it will be harder for the defensive backs to lose in coverage in a short time frame, meaning Seattle's secondary will be less prone to being gashed in the air game with an improved defensive line that can lessen the time needed for the secondary to maintain complete coverage.

**Luke Wypler - C - Ohio State - Pick 3.83:**

While most of these picks should get starting snaps during their rookie season, it's quite possible that Luke Wypler doesn't get any starting snaps in year 1. Evan Brown would likely win the starting role and maintain it during the season, barring any injuries of course. But the upside with Wypler comes with his athleticism and his age. With the Waldron zone scheme the Seahawks run, better athletes are required along the offensive line. You could see that with Cross and Lucas last year, with both those guys being players who can quickly get to the 2nd level and make blocks in space. Any center the Seahawks draft will probably be on the smaller side in terms of weight and frame, but they will certainly be plus athletes like Wypler. Being 21, Wypler will have plenty of time to be developed and probably has more good years in the league than a guy like John Michael Schmitz, who is a 5th-year senior and already 24 years old.

With Wypler there will have to be plenty of development done regarding his body coordination in pass pro, play strength, and anchor. He also doesn't pack as much power in his hands as you would want, but these are all things that Coach Dickerson can develop over time. If Evan Brown doesn't pan out the Seahawks will have Wypler ready to step up and take the starting spot, reducing one need for next year's draft. If Brown has an extended stay in Seattle, Wypler will make for great depth until he is able to become the starter.

The Seahawks signed Evan Brown after his market never seemed to materialize in the early stages of free agency. Brown has played both center and guard during his tenure with the Lions, but was an above-average player at the center and will play there for the Seahawks during the 2023 season. Evan Brown was signed to a cheap 1-year deal worth around $2 million, meaning Seattle does not have any large financial ties with him and could go into the season with a rookie starting and Brown being a reserve offensive lineman for both the center and guard positions. If the Seahawks draft Luke Wypler he could easily beat out Brown during training camp and start the season week 1. The Seahawks made a massive mistake in the draft when they took Dee Eskridge over All-Pro Perennial center Creed Humphrey and have had weak center play since then, but the Seahawks need to learn from their mistakes and not be afraid to draft a center high even though they missed on Ethan Pocic half a decade ago. If the Seahawks learn from their mistakes and choose to take a rookie center over-relying on veterans to play well, this could transform their offensive line into a fully young group that has all the potential to be superstars in the near future.

**Israel Abanikanda - RB - Pitt - Pick 4.123:**

While most Seahawk fans were livid about the team using a 2nd round pick on a running back last year, we now know that the pick, Kenneth Walker III, will be the future of the Seahawks' RB room for the foreseeable future. However, there is a lack of depth behind him, which is where Ibanikanda comes in. Like Walker, Abanikanda is a home run hitter. He's able to quickly accelerate to his top speed and leave defenders in the dust when given just a little bit of space. He lacks the lateral explosiveness/twitch and outside running ability that Walker has, which makes him a nice complement as a dangerous between-the-tackle runner. Abanikanda's ceiling is being a co-RB1 with Walker if he can improve his vision. Additionally he has can be an extra pass catcher on third downs.

The Seahawks currently have two running backs on their roster. Kenneth Walker is the clear starter and will remain on the roster. DeeJay Dallas is the second running back, but in an ideal world should be the third or fourth RB on the depth chart. The Seahawks have badly needed that "bruiser" RB ever since Chris Carson retired due to medical concerns. Israel is that perfect complement that, like Carson, has speed with which he can run upfield. Walker would be the running back on downs where plays could be either a run or pass, while Israel would be back on 3rd and short or 2nd and short where the team needs one of their RBs to pick up a few yards to keep the drive going. If Israel can emerge as a pass catcher he could be the team's 3rd down back and replace Travis Homer's former role on the team. In a few years as Israel and Kenneth ease into the NFL and become highly valued veterans, the team may be witnessing one of the better RB duos of the last decade emerging into a star running back room.  

**Jay Ward - S - LSU - Pick 5.151:**

Ward is a walking Swiss army knife. He played just about every position in the secondary for LSU in 2022, and he played them all well. With the lower positional value of safeties and Ward not being an elite athlete, he falls to the Seahawks' pick in the 5th, but it may be one of the best places for him to land. Seattle has plenty of experience in their safety room with the likes of Quandre Diggs, Jamal Adams, and Julian Love. It would be extremely beneficial to Ward to be able to learn and grow from these guys, especially fellow versatile DB Julian Love. Ward provides quality depth at both safety positions and at nickel, but ideally, he will be a starter at free safety when the Seahawks move on from Quandre Diggs.

The Seahawks cut Ryan Neal after tendering him due to his cap hit that seemed all too expensive after their unexpected free agency spree. Drafting Ward would be the most ideal replacement in a secondary that has versatility across the field. The most similar player currently on Seattle's team to Ward would be Julian Love, who also has played every position in the secondary. Seattle could provide unique defensive back coverages with Adams playing in the box, Love playing as a corner, Diggs playing as a nickel, and Ward playing as another corner. While Ward is not being mixed in Seattle's scheme with different packages he would provide depth to every position in the secondary due to his versatility and would be an immediate starter if any player suffered an injury.

**Roschon Johnson - RB - Texas - Pick 5.154:**   

Johnson's 6'0 225 LB frame will give the Seahawks a big power-back to use on the goalline, but his value doesn't end there. He possesses the acceleration and vision to create big-chunk gains for the Seahawks' offense. His role projection in the NFL is similar to Abanikanda's (A between-the-tackles runner), but his running style is more physical, with his bigger frame helping him survive contact from defenders. He should be a great change-of-pace guy and a dangerous pass catcher out of the backfield on 3rd downs. Johnson also has the ability to fill the pass-blocking back role left vacant by Travis Homer.

The Seahawks would have Ken Walker, Israel, and Dallas as their 3-RBs entering the 2023 season, but running backs are one of the most injury-prone positions on the field and Seattle's running backs have a lengthy history, justifying the selection of another day-3 running back that draws similarities to Chris Carson. With Israel only being drafted a round before Johnson, Seattle would be happy to allow both RBs to duel for the power back and 3rd down back roles of the team and start the winner alongside Walker in week 1. Johnson also is known for his pass-blocking, another element of Seattle's game that left with Travis Homer and hasn't been replenished since.

**Cory Trice - CB - Purdue - Pick 6.198:**   

The SeahawksToday Cory Trice report will be coming out soon, but when watching his tape you can expect to see another Pete Carroll-style corner; great size and length, physical playstyle, and the skill set to be a great fit in a cover 3 defense.

Specifically focusing on the positional value, Seattle would be more than happy to draft another late-round CB in hopes that Pete Carroll can draw the best out of them and turn them into full-time starters. Trice has all the potential and length to learn from Carroll and become a menace in Carroll's coveted Cover-3 scheme. Trice would be competing with the likes of Michael Jackson Sr. and Tre Brown for the chance to start week 1 alongside DROY Finalist Tariq Woolen.

**Elijah Higgins - WR - Stanford - Pick 7.237:**   

Higgins gives the Seahawks' offense another big target in the passing game. At 6'3 235 LBs, Higgins can compete for the team's WR4 spot while also giving the Seahawks another big blocker on the outside to further support the run game.

Seattle drafts their 3rd WR in the 7th round in the last 2 years hoping Higgins can make the roster as the team's 4th WR. The hope would be Higgins could develop as a blocker and help improve Seattle's WR blocking room to a higher level. Higgins and Young may battle it out for the team's 4th WR spot, but regardless of who loses the battle they will, more likely than not, replace Penny Hart as the last WR on Seattle's depth chart.
