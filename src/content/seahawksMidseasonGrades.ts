Seahawks Today Lead Writers: Shrihun Sankepally and Nevin Tamilselvan

**Quarterback**

Geno Smith: Geno Smith has had an incredible start to the season, outplaying many other great QBs such as Aaron Rodgers and Tom Brady en route to leading his team to a 5-3 record. Smith has now played himself into an MVP candidate, with a league-high 72% completion percentage and close to 2000 yards with 13 touchdowns to only 3 interceptions. He has definitely exceeded expectations.

Grade: A+

**Running Back**

Kenneth Walker: Despite coming into the season injured, Walker has broken out in a big way after the injury to Rashaad Penny. He has become the favorite to win OROY after getting 4 touchdowns in 3 starts, over 300 yards, and close to 5.5 yards per carry. He easily is a main staple of the Seahawks for years to come.

Grade: A

**Tight End**

Will Dissly: Many expected the contract that Dissly got in the off-season to be a massive overpay after 2 seasons of mediocre play following 2 devastating injuries. In this season, he has so far been a reliable safety blanket, catching over 90% of his targets and many of those being a first down conversion, making him a key part of making the offense consistent game-to-game.

Grade: A

Noah Fant: Received in the Russell Wilson trade, Fant was expected to be the most important of the 3 players the Seahawks received as he was the youngest one with the most potential. He has played decently to start the season but hasn't made quite the notable impact that was expected, especially with the increased usage of tight ends this year. He has been hindered by some drops and has been outplayed by Will Dissly. He has made progress as a blocker, which was a clear weakness in his game with the Broncos.

Grade: B+

Colby Parkinson: Parkinson has been a pleasant surprise this year, as much was not expected for the athletic marvel this year as TE3 and being injured for a large part of the year last year. He has been productive in this new scheme, already having 150 yards and 1 touchdown as the 5th-6th option on this offense. He has come into his own as a blocker as well, able to utilize his big frame to create gaps in the running game.

Grade: B+

**Wide Reciever**

DK Metcalf: Expectations for the superstar newly-extended receiver were somewhat tempered this season with the exodus of QB Russell Wilson with Geno Smith, someone who many thought would be a downgrade. While Smith has played exceptionally, Metcalf has not played to a level that he has shown before. Part of this is due to injuries he's been affected by in the past 2 weeks, and part of it is due to a new reliance on tight ends and running backs that was not present when Metcalf was at his best. Metcalf has also had games where he has not used his full opportunities, such as in the Week 5 game against the Saints where Metcalf dropped one touchdown and then, later on, fumbled the ball which led to a Saints touchdown. If these types of games get cleaned up, there's no telling what Metcalf could do with his potential.

Grade: B-

Tyler Lockett: Lockett was the type of player with Russell Wilson who made a living off the deep ball and was more technically efficient compared to his counterpart, DK Metcalf. This reliance on deep plays made people wonder if his production would go down with a new QB who could be worse downfield. Geno, however, has played exceptionally downfield, and Lockett himself has been less reliant on the deep ball, posting his 2nd-lowest yards-per-catch of his career en route to leading the team in yards and receptions.

Grade: A-

Marquise Goodwin: Goodwin was signed in the middle of training camp and was not expected to even make the roster ahead of players who already saw playing time last season as Freddie Swain or Dee Eskridge. Goodwin has instead taken control of the WR3 position and played well when Lockett and Metcalf are injured, such as in Week 7 against the Chargers, where he had 2 touchdowns.

Grade: B

Dee Eskridge: Eskridge, the Seahawks 2nd round pick in 2021, has failed to meet the expectations placed upon him. He struggled through injuries in his rookie season and barely managed to get on the field. This season he has been playing more but has still yet to make the impact that many envisioned he could with his 2nd-round selection. He had a nice performance against the Cardinals in a game where the offense was mostly stifled, but then played badly in the week following that, where he fumbled the ball on a pitch and had an offensive pass-interference penalty on a 22-yard screen to Marquise Goodwin.

Grade: C-

**Offensive Tackles**

Charles Cross: The Seahawks' 21-year-old rookie tackle has played above average so far into the season, specifically in the pass-blocking game. While he hasn't played all the way up to his No. 9 overall selection yet, there is still plenty of time for Cross to grow into a franchise cornerstone at left tackle.

Grade: B+

Abraham Lucas: Lucas, like Cross, came from a pass-heavy scheme and has played well in the run-blocking and pass-blocking game this season. After being drafted in the 3rd round, Lucas looks like a steal as he has become a stud at the right tackle position and has easily outplayed the expectations placed on him at the beginning of the season.

Grade: A-

**Offensive Guards**

Phil Haynes: Haynes has played in a primary backup spot for RG Gabe Jackson and LG Damien Lewis, and during this time he played well, especially in the run-blocking department. He has been plagued by injuries, in his career, however, something that should be taken into account with Gabe Jackson and Damien Lewis both also somewhat prone to injury.

Grade: B+

Gabe Jackson: Gabe Jackson was acquired from the Raiders the last off-season and was known for his prowess in the pass-blocking game. Jackson has declined this season, however, and with only one year left after this season, it could make sense for the Seahawks to move on, either with Haynes replacing him or acquiring a new guard.

Grade: B-

Damien Lewis: Damien Lewis was a good player as a rookie in 2020 but had a bit of a sophomore slump in 2021 after being moved to LG following the acquisition of Gabe Jackson. With Lewis remaining at LG, he has played better than before in pass-blocking but still remains somewhat inconsistent in the run game.

Grade: B-

**Center**

Austin Blythe: Blythe played with the Rams in 2020 with current Seahawks OC Shane Waldron and current Offensive Line coach Andy Dickerson, and then this offseason signed a 1-year deal with the Seahawks. He has played well in Seattle thus far as a pass-blocker while also generating a good push in the run game.

Grade: A-  

![](https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/025922ce-6732-4551-a0f0-8dce60f67311_1000x751.jpeg)

**Interior Defensive Line**

Poona Ford: Ford was expected to have more of an impact this season with the switch to a 3-4 defense that emphasized putting pressure on the quarterback. While Ford struggled at the beginning of the season, he has played well in the last 3 games, becoming a key part of stopping the run and more of a presence in the pass rush, getting 2 sacks and 3 pressures in the last 3 games.

Grade: B

Al Woods: Woods was a surprise signing by the Seahawks last season and he paid dividends for them, becoming a monster in the middle while clogging runs and swallowing opposing running backs. After signing an extension this season with the Seahawks, he's done more of the same throughout the season, becoming a key leader along the defensive line.

Grade: A-

Shelby Harris: Acquired in the Russell Wilson trade, Harris has been a force on the defensive line, generating 3 TFLs, 20 tackles, 15 pressures, and one sack as a rotational interior defensive lineman. He has played with great enthusiasm and motor that allows him to make key stops, such as last week where he tackled Giants QB Daniel Jones short of the first-down marker to force a punt late in the 4th quarter.

Grade: B+

Quinton Jefferson: Jefferson signed a 2 year deal with the Seahawks this free agency and has had some success as a pass rusher, recording 3 sacks and 9 pressures this season while on a relatively consistent level. Jefferson could easily have a bigger role as the Seahawks' defense has broken into an elite level of play as it has for the past 3 weeks.

Grade: B+

**Outside Linebacker**

Uchenna Nwosu: Nwosu was the Seahawks' main free agency signing this year after he agreed to a 2-year $20 million dollar deal. So far he has lived up to that status, consistently generating pressure on the quarterback and pressure, so far recording 5 sacks (tying his career high in a season) and 12 pressures.

Grade: A

Darrell Taylor: Taylor was the Seahawks 2nd round pick in 2020 who played well in his "rookie" season last year (he missed all of the 2020 season with a leg injury), but came into the 2022 season with issues in run defense. These issues led to 2022 2nd round pick Boye Mafe to instead get the start ahead of Taylor and instead mix Taylor in on passing downs, which has worked as part of the Seahawks' defensive revitalization. He has played well in the last 2 games (excluding the Giants game where he was injured), recording sacks for forced fumbles in each.

Grade: B-

Boye Mafe: Mafe's role in the defense has grown week by week after taking over the starting spot for Darell Taylor. Mafe is great at setting the edge in run defense which made him a prime candidate to start on early-down rushing plays. This past week Mafe also played through many of Taylor's pass-rushing snaps due to Taylor's injury. He was able to record some pressure and sacked Giants QB, Daniel Jones. Even though Mafe may not be that much of a pass-rushing threat right now, he has lots of potential for the future.

Grade: B

**Linebackers**

Jordyn Brooks: Jordyn Brooks had high expectations for the Seahawks in 2022 as the new LB1. While Brooks has played better this season compared to last, he still has issues in coverage but has overall tightened up his play as has the whole defense in the last 3 weeks.

Grade: B

Cody Barton: Expected to be the ILB, Barton struggled to start the season, making key errors in run defense which eventually led to decreased snaps for him. He however got better within the last 3 weeks, tightening up in the run game and making key plays in coverage, such as a 4th down pass deflection.

Grade: B-  

![](https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/c0bf6425-1d78-4c6f-b0a3-dc847d6ef1ec_1200x800.jpeg)

**Cornerbacks**

Tariq Woolen: Woolen was expected to barely play this season and instead be more of a long-term project. He instead beat the odds and is starting at RCB and is tied for 2nd in the league with 4 interceptions. His freakish athletic traits and instincts allow him to make plays on the ball, so much so that many quarterbacks have stopped targeting his part of the field as much. If woolen keeps this up, he could be a favorite to win DROY along with Jets CB Sauce Gardner.

Grade: A+

Coby Bryant: Coby Bryant struggled in coverage at the beginning of the year, getting beat for a 50+ yard touchdown on some of his first NFL snaps. Since then, he has improved each week and has also been incredible at forcing fumbles, causing a league-leading 4 forced fumbles as a rookie.

Grade: B+

Michael Jackson: Michael Jackson was a practice squad pickup last year who has excelled in Seattle (as is the case with many corners in Pete Caroll's tenure). He has become great in recent weeks at tackling and overall physical play, as shown last week when he single-handedly had 3 pass deflections.

Grade: A-

**Safety**

Quandre Diggs: Quandre Diggs is coming off his 2nd straight Pro Bowl selection, but this season has been off to a rough start. He has been good in pass coverage but has somewhat regressed in run defense, letting receivers bounce off him for chunk yardage gains. He has improved in the last 3 weeks, becoming a more secure tackler and returning back to form.

Grade: B

Ryan Neal: Ryan Neal was not even expected to play this season as the Seahawks finally had Safety Jamal Adams healthy. However, Adams had a season-ending injury in Week 1 against the Broncos, Neal still did not play until Josh Jones was benched. Since then, Neal has played extremely well, especially in the last 3 games, where he has played a key part in the defense's strong stretch of play.

Grade: A

Josh Jones: Josh Jones was a training camp standout that was the immediate replacement for Jamal Adams. However, Jones struggled heavily in run defense, contributing to the Seahawks having one of the worst run defenses in the league during the first 5 weeks.

Grade: C-
