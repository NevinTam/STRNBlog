A true NFL journeyman, Michael Jackson has played on several teams throughout his NFL career, such as the Patriots and Lions, before playing for the Seahawks following his acquisition 2021 offseason. Throughout these teams, Jackson had played with many talented players, including former Patriot Stephon Gilmore. After playing in so many systems, he mentions how he has been able to learn so many different skills that he can then put together in Seattle to truly excel.

"I've learned so much football from being in different systems and seeing different offenses to the point where once I got to Seattle, it was like, 'now I'm at the point where I can put everything together' "

Two players that really helped with Jackson's transition to the NFL prior to his tenure with the Seahawks was CB Stephon Gilmore and CB JC Jackson. They both helped make him view the cornerback position in differing playstyles.

"Gilmore, he's a thinker. Like, throw the ball at the opposite hash, chances are you not getting an out route - it's a long throw. He really breaks it down ... With JC Jackson, it's all about the ball. He's always looking back for the ball ... His main thing is always looking back for the ball at all times"

When he first joined the NFL, Jackson says the hardest part of adjusting to the league was getting used to the pacing, the speed of the game as it differed from the college level to the professional level.

"The NFL is just, like, more mental. In college, if you just more athletic than the other person than you gon' win. But in the NFL, all of us, for the most part, are the same ... for the most part, it's an even playing field. You have to really anticipate what's about to happen"

After joining Seattle on the practice squad, Jackson mentions he had to keep working on the practice squad till he was able to get the opportunity to really get suited for the 53 man roster and play consistently on Sundays.

"The practice squad is exactly what it is, you're just practicing ... you're in the NFL but it don't feel like it 'cause on Sunday's you're still in sweats. Some teams you not even out there ... I just gotta keep working till I get my opportunity. Once I got it I wasn't letting it go"

One thing that Jackson would bring to Seattle would be his confidence and fun personality, especially in a place like Seattle, where he feels like the game can be fun and where you can bring the energy, which is a unique experience for Seattle compared to other teams.

"Pete makes the game fun ... When I got to Seattle, I realized I could relax and be myself - my authentic self - I don't have to try and be someone else ... I want to be that fun and cool guy"

Jackson also mentions wanting to be a leader for a few of the rookies, citing how he never had a veteran presence as a rookie on the defensive side of the ball to help him adjust to the game and NFL life.

"I never had a vet in my room to take me under their wing and show me stuff outside of football. We all go through the same stuff. It might be a little bit different but it really the same thing. I want to be that teammate that you can talk to outside of football ... At the end of the day, we going to war with each other ... I want to have a relationship with you"

During his first NFL start against the Broncos, Jackson remarks that the game was extremely loud. I don't think I can sum it up any better than Jackson said it himself.

"It \[the stadium\] was shaking. I couldn't hear anything for the first 6 plays ... it was hard to think ... they \[the safeties\] couldn't hear me"

Now following that game, Jackson knows that one thing he has to consider is the loudness factor of any game at any stadium, including his home stadium. The feeling of adjusting to that loudness can feel like it's forever.

In the past offseason, Jackson mentions that the biggest thing he changed was that he engaged in boxing workouts alongside his normal DB and Track workouts.

"Boxing is, in my opinion, an underappreciated sport because the amount of shape you have to be in to fight someone for 3 minutes - its a long time ... they doing so many reps that lifting 3 pounds feels like 30. They have to train their whole body to take punches but also give punches"

This relates to football because Jackson can use boxing as a relatable skill to playing corner, especially when jamming the receiver at the line of scrimmage.

Jackson sees the new up-coming Seahawks corners such as Devon Witherspoon, Tariq Woolen, and Coby Bryant as less of a rivalry and more of a team and a supportive mindset around players at the same position.

"You have new faces come in the room weekly ... we're teammates, we're competing, but we don't go against each other ... I want you to make plays, I want you to be successful ... I don't wish down on no man. Competition brings out the best in everybody. If we in a room full of dawgs, then how can we lose? We want to know if he can hold his own because there'll come a time where we gon have to depend on him to make a play. If you win, we all win.

Jackson felt that his biggest game as a football player was when he was on Miami and intercepted two passes (almost three due to a dropped pick) against Syracuse in college in the 2017 NCAA season.

"That day was the best moment because I found out that I was having a son that Monday. Back in college, me and the secondary would practice our celebrations in practice, so I would rock the baby when I got an interception ... it was crazy ... his \[my son\] nickname is Two-Time, so I looked at the camera and said that, it was wild. One of my best moments"

To Jackson, his biggest lesson, something that he would tell himself at the beginning of his journey, would be to be patient.

"Everybody have their own race. Don't look at other guys. I didn't really start playing till year 4. I'd rather that then go out in year 1 and do bad and then be out the league. It's not about when the opportunity comes, it's about what you do when you get it."
