## **DL: 6**
***Leonard Williams*** is a lock to be on the roster after receiving $64.5 million contract this offseason. Williams looks to have a solid year after posting 4 sacks in just 10 games last year while playing 18 games. ***Jarran Reed*** should also be a solid contributor, especially with the team adding more defensive line depth because last year Reed's production fell off around midway through the season. Before midway, Reed was putting up numbers comparable to the better defensive tackles in the league. First round pick ***Byron Murphy II*** has had lofty comparisons to Aaron Donald this offseason and has been b orderline [unstoppable](https://twitter.com/TodaySeahawks/status/1783696119731749035) in the few snaps he has played this preseason. ***Johnathan Hankins*** will be a perfect complement to Jarran Reed to eat up double teams and help a run defense that was near the bottom of the NFL in 2023. ***Mike Morris*** has played both standing up and across the defensive line this preseason and the 2023 rookie looks to be a good rotiational piece under his former Michigan DC Mike Macdonald. ***Myles Adams*** makes the roster as the last defensive linemen in part for his solid play this offseason and as a nice rotational piece.
#### **Safe: Williams, Reed, Murphy, Hankins, Morris, Adams**
‎ 
## **EDGE: 4**
***Uchenna Nwosu*** is the team's best EDGE by far, and it isn't particularly close. After suffering a brutal pec injury in 2023, Nwosu will [return](https://twitter.com/TodaySeahawks/status/1813775957645488181) in 2024. ***Boye Mafe*** has not particularly stood out this offseason but played well in the preseason game. Regardless, the team hopes he can build on his 9.0 sack season in 2023. ***Derick Hall*** 2023 2nd round pick struggled in many facets of the game in his rookie season. In 2024, he looks like a different player and looks to have a similar [breakout](https://twitter.com/TodaySeahawks/status/1825577702256161183) season as Mafe did in 2023. ***Dre'Mont Jones*** is technically a DL but under Coach Macdonald will most likely play both. With ***Darrell Taylor*** being traded ([INSTANT ANALYSIS: Darrell Taylor Traded](https://www.seahawks-today.com/darrellTaylorTrade)), Jones will likely need to step up as an EDGE. ***Jamie Sheriff*** has put together an incredibly impressive preseason and will likely be the 5th EDGE on the team, but just on the practice squad.

#### **Safe: Nwosu, Mafe, Hall, Jones**

## **LB: 4**
***Jerome Baker*** despite missing much of the offseason program in 2024 is expected to return in week 1 against the Denver Broncos for the season opener. ***Tyrel Dodson*** has played well in his limited snaps this preseason and will look to build off his impressive  [2023 campaign](https://twitter.com/TodaySeahawks/status/1768421668136030405). ***Tyrice Knight*** 4th round pick in the draft lofted queastion marks from many, but Macdonald very much wanted him for his tackling ability that has been showcased all throughout the preseason thus far. Knight could be a week 1 starter if Baker is not ready against Denver. ***Patrick o'Connell*** makes the team over ***Jon Rhattigan*** who has not had a great preseason. Michael Jackson was traded for 2024 7th round LB ***Michael Barrett*** who has familiarity with Macdonald from Michigan, but Barrett is a question mark to play in this 3rd preseason game and will most likely end up on the practice squad.
#### **Safe: Baker, Dodson, Knight, O'Connell**
‎ 

## **CB: 6**
Rookie sensation ***Riq Woolen*** probably did not perform to the best of his ability last season, but was still elite in coverage. This year, he looks like the team's best defensive player and it isn't very close. ***Devon Witherspoon*** had a strong rookie season playing nickel in 2023, but will look to maintain that level of improve upon it to enter "elite CB" territory. ***Tre Brown*** has looked extremely good thus far in the offseason and while the team could've traded him instead of ***Michael Jackson***, it doesn't make sense as Brown looks to make a nice for himself in a contract year. ***Artie Burns*** has been slept on this camp and is the 2nd best nickel on the roster behind Witherspoon, so makes it in this  ***Nehemiah Pritchett*** has outperformed is other Auburn rookie counterpart in ***DJ James*** this offseason, but with Jackson being traded, both make the roster.

#### **Safe: Woolen, Witherspoon, Brown, Burns, Pritchett, James**

## **S: 5**
***Julian Love*** looks to build on top of a Pro Bowl season as the team's safety #1 this year after being behind ***Quandre Diggs*** and ***Jamal Adams*** on the depth chart last year. ***Rayshawn Jenkins*** can play all over the field and is currently injured but is expected to be back to reclaim the 2nd safety position. ***K'Von Wallace*** has looked extremely good so far this offseason and could make a name for himself on the team this season, being recognized by Macdonald for his determination to learn. ***Coby Bryant*** did not play much in 2023 after having a solid 2022 year as a nickel CB. Now, Bryant is a safety and has looked alright there and can be a solid 4th safety. ***Marquise Blair***, the Seahawks 2nd round pick from 2019, made his way back on the Seahawks roster this season and is a very hard hitter. Some gruesome injuries haven't helped Blair throughout the years, but Blair looks like he could become the player the Seahawks drafted 5 years ago. 
#### **Safe: Love, Jenkins, Wallace, Bryant, Blair**
