It's been a while, but I'm finally back with another draft article. A big thank you to everyone for staying patient with me.  

In today's dose of the pre-draft process, we'll again be looking at some of the big players that have had their stock plummet over the course of the season. Some of these players were hyped in preseason mock drafts, but have since disappointed in their performance. For some of these players, I was surprised to see them play poorly, but for some, I can say that it was an expected drop-off.  

All of these guys will have different levels of drops. Some of them have fallen down a few rounds, while some may have just fallen farther down in the first. But enough with the dilly-dallying, let's get to it!

Eli Ricks - CB - Alabama  

The top corner on many preseason boards. Ricks has failed to earn the spotlight among a talent-stacked Alabama defense, not starting until Alabama's week 8 game vs Mississippi State. While his measurables and athletic traits have NFL coaches salivating, I do think that he needs another year under Nick Saban to truly be the top corner in the draft. He currently lacks consistent footwork and he will tend to get handsy with receivers at times. However, there is a possibility that he gets his stock back up and declares. But that's only if he continues to produce a consistent play for the 'Bama defense. But this is a matter of if, not when.   



Tyler Van Dyke - QB - Miami  

Coming into the season, Van Dyke was generally considered the 4th ranked QB - behind Levis, Young, and Stroud. However, it's safe to say he has been far from up to par over the first half of the season. Van Dyke has not had a QBR above 80 this season, and his overall play has been inconsistent from game to game. He has also had to deal with injuries to his upper body throughout the season. If I were Van Dyke, I would stay back at Miami (or transfer) for another season. He really needs to do some work on his throwing mechanics, which I think is a major reason for his accuracy issues. If he does declare, I don't think a front office should get near him till the early third round.

Bryan Bresee - IDL - Clemson  

I would like to start this off by sending condolences to the Bresee family and Bryan, who has lost his sister this season. The passing of a loved one is difficult for anyone to deal with, and Bresee has to deal with football on top of his grief. With that being said, his play this season has been far from spectacular or a top 10 picks worthy. He has failed to generate much pressure and his teammates have been outshining him on the field and in stats. I still think Bresee can still get back on track this season. In my eyes, his stock has not fallen out of the top 20 yet, and his potential has definitely been evident in past seasons.  

Arik Gilbert - TE - Georgia  

Gilbert is one of the guys on this list that I think should definitely stay in school for another year. When he transferred to Georgia from LSU, many people believed that he would be competing for starting reps with the 2 tight ends already there, Darnell Washington and Brock Bowers. He has failed to do so and has fallen from the middle first round into day 3 projections if he declares at all. Gilbert does have the athletic traits to be a great NFL tight end, but he will need another year of solid play in college to show NFL teams that his potential can be tangible.

Kayshon Boutte - WR - LSU  

Before the season began, I had Boutte as my number 1 ranked receiver in the class, above Smith-Njigba and Addison. Instead of building off the stellar season he had last year, Boutte seems to have taken a step back. But I will have a bit more hope for Boutte after his performance during the past few weeks. He seems to have gotten it back together after the QB and coaching change this past off-season. Boutte is still showing those elite traits that made me grade him so highly preseason, but I want him to show he can dominate more consistently with his route running and not just his speed. I still think that Boutte will declare this year, but whether he is the first WR taken off the board will depend on how he plays for the remainder of the season.
