***Mazi Smith: IDL***

***Michigan - 6'3 - 323 LB***

Games watched: vs Ohio State (2022), TCU (2022), Iowa (2022)



Grading Scale:  

![](https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/671495d5-2d86-4880-b955-873e4699da84_877x640.png)

Mazi Smith Grade:

Strengths:

-Good placement on initial punch. Great length helps him win leverage against lineman. Maintains active hands during pass-rush reps

-Smith brings great athleticism and pass rush upside as a nose tackle.

Shortcomings:

-Still needs some development on his pass rush moves

-Needs to work on holding his anchor as a run defender

Summary:

MazI Smith is another great athlete on the defensive interior looking to make a splash in the NFL Draft. Smith is a great athlete with the size and length to be an elite nose tackle in the NFL. He will be able to stay on the field on passing downs due to his high pass rush upside and athletic abilities. As a nose tackle he has to become better at anchoring himself in run defense and not allowing offensive lineman to wash him out of the play. Smith also has to work on his move skillset to truly reach his ceiling as a pass rusher. If he can work these flaws out of his game, Mazi Smith can definitely become a top end nose tackle at the next level. I would take him in the early 2nd.

**Numerical Grade: 82/100**

**Projection: Floor - Backup/Rotational Player -----\> Ceiling - Perennial All-Pro**

**Round Grade: Early D2**

**Ade Ade's Scouting Report:**

Grading Scale:

Ade Ade Grade:

Strengths:

-Combine testing shows up on tape. Adebawore is explosive off the line with great lateral quickness and pursuit speed. He has a smaller frame but with great length

-Super quick hands; Puts himself in a great position to win with his first move

Shortcomings:

-Doesn't consistently get off blocks on the interior; He is a lighter guy, so he will have to work on staying in control of his gap and winning at the attack point at the next level

-Lacks a full arsenal of pass rush moves; lacks a plan to win or counter lineman

-Needs to become a more consistent tackler; could improve pad level a little

Summary:

Northwestern's Adetomiwa Adebawore burst onto the scene at the senior bowl, but really started to boost his draft stock after his freakish testing at the combine. Teams will look to mold him into a super disruptive player on the interior, but before that he definitely has some work on his game. There's no denying that Adebawore is an exceptional athlete, as he brings elite explosiveness and agility to the interior. His length and quick hands allow him to win in multiple ways in the passing game. As a run defender Adebawore can quickly get through gaps with his quickness, but improving his ability to consistently shed lineman and win at the point of attack should be a key point of improvement. Adebawore will also have to improve his pass rush prowess, as he currently lacks the ability to counter lineman after his first move. Nevertheless, teams should look to get Adebawore very early on day 2 of the draft.

**Numerical Grade: 82/100**

**Round Grade: Early D2**
