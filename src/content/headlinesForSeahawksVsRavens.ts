**Seahawks WRs vs Ravens CB Core**

The Seahawks WR core is coming off another productive game, one where Tyler Lockett was back to his usual reliable self and with Metcalf making the occasional big play. Metcalf could have easily gone for a 100+ but QB Geno Smith was unusually inaccurate when targeting Metcalf, missing him several times on easy throws he could have completed. JSN also had several huge catches, gaining a first down on a 19-yard screen in the 1st quarter and the game-winning touchdown on another screen late in the 4th quarter. They will need to keep up this level of production and will likely require more as they face a vaunted Ravens secondary, led by CBs Brandon Stephens and Marlon Humphrey. JSN will also have a critical role, as he has started to heat up in the last 3 weeks, totaling 11 receptions for 147 yards and 2 touchdowns. He will likely be matched up against CB Arthur Maulet, who has played well this season through 6 games. The Seahawks will need a productive day from these receivers to maintain an offensive consistency that they were missing for most of last game against the Browns.

**Ravens QB Lamar Jackson vs Seahawks LBs + SS Jamal Adams**

QB Lamar Jackson is one of the most electrifying players in the NFL with his dual-threat rushing and passing ability. His rushing ability will be something the Seahawks will have to monitor. Jackson already has the most rushing yards of any non-RB and is averaging over 5 YPC. The Seahawks have struggled against mobile QBs in the last few games, as Josh Dobbs was able to string together a few big runs during the Cardinals game, and PJ Walker was able to gain several first downs using his legs. The Seahawks, especially their linebackers and Jamal Adams, will have to be on point to halt Jackson's rushing. It is likely this could mean the use of a QB spy that is meant to watch Jackson and ensure that he is properly contained. This requires a highly athletic player, which will likely mean if a spy is used, it will either be Adams or LB Jordyn Brooks, who has been showing off his athleticism throughout the season in run defense and coverage.

**Seahawks OTs vs Ravens EDGE Group**

Looking at the Ravens EDGE group, you see a budding star in Odafe Oweh on one side with former Seahawk Jadeveon Clowney on the other. Clowney is playing extremely well this season, arguably his best since his 2019 season with the Seahawks. Oweh is only 24 and has been a key reason for a stellar Ravens defense. The Seahawks will have second-year star Charles Cross at left tackle with a combination of 41-year-old Jason Peters and Stone Forsythe across from him. While Forsythe and Peters played well against a vaunted Browns defense, they are not Abe Lucas. If they can hold their own against a good Ravens EDGE group, that may be the reason why Seattle comes out of this game with a victory. Charles Cross should be able to lock down any Ravens EDGE that he lines up against, as he locked down potential Defensive Player of the Year Myles Garrett last year to one of his worst games of the season. This matchup could go either way, but Seattle should have a slight edge against the Ravens EDGEs.

**Seahawks Rushing Attack vs Ravens Front 7**

The Seahawks have mainly started Kenneth Walker this season, but last game proved to be different with rookie RB Zach Charbonnet recording more carries. The Ravens have a stout defense and to open up the pass game, the run game will need to be efficient. A combination of Charbonnet to run straight up the middle and Kenneth Walker to the outside should be the game plan going into this game, seeing how effective it was last year. The Ravens have good EDGEs in Odafe Oweh and Jadeveon Clowney as well as a very good run defending defensive line with Michael Pierce and Justin Madubuike. Seattle's offensive linemen will need to be able to hold up in the run game and create open lanes for Seattle's running backs, otherwise, the offense will most likely stutter and fail to score. In the modern NFL, teams are passing more than ever, but Seattle will have to get back to its roots in a game that will most likely be won within trenches based on line play, but also in the run game to set up the pass game.
