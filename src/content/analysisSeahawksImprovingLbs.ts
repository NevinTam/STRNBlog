After struggling in both run defense and pass defense at the beginning of the season, the linebacker duo of Cody Barton and Jordyn Brooks have played much better as of late, especially in pass coverage. Read below for specific details on each player.

**Cody Barton**

At the beginning of the offseason, many were skeptical of Cody Barton despite playing decently well for 2 games at the end of the 2021 season when former LB Bobby Wagner got injured. Following Wagner's release on March 8th, the franchise opted to keep Cody Barton, leading to said skepticism over trusting a player like Barton, who had primarily played special teams, to be even an average starter at linebacker after being on the bench for 3 years. These doubts grew louder after the first few games of the Seahawks season, where Barton seemed ineffective in tackling and gave up a high completion percentage. The Seahawks then started to play him fewer snaps at the beginning of their winning streak in Week 6, which helped Barton and he slowly saw more and more snaps as the weeks progressed. He's since made strides in coverage, getting targeted less and making key plays, including 2 interceptions in the past 3 games. If Barton keeps up this level of play, the Seahawks may consider keeping him next year, even as a backup linebacker if they see someone more enticing in the draft or free agency.

**Jordyn Brooks**

Jordyn Brooks was always a big part of the Seahawks future after they spent a first-round pick on him in the 2020 draft. His role has increased every year and following the release of Bobby Wagner, he was cemented as the ILB1 on the defense. He has also played better as he progresses, as last year he gave up over 1000 yards in coverage in a year where the Seahawks defense struggled heavily with getting off the field, allowing lots of yardage and time to be taken off by opposing offenses. This year, Brooks started off similarly, as he was on pace to again give up 1000 yards, especially within the first few weeks where the Seahawks defense as a whole was playing like one of the worst in the league. Brooks has improved in coverage in recent weeks, like Barton, and is on pace to only allow 750 yards, which would be a major improvement from where he was previously. Part of this is because of how he has improved in communication with Barton, allowing for less players to be open in the middle. While Brooks may never be an elite coverage linebacker, if he is able to still be good in the run game while being at least average in coverage, he will most likely be a Seahawk for a long time.
