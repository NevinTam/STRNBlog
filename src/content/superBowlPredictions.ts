### **Who will win the game?**

**Hieuton** : I've got the Eagles in this one. In the Chiefs' AFC divisional matchup against the Bengals, the young KC corners were often outmatched by the likes of Ja'marr Chase and Tee Higgins. What saved them was the Chiefs D-line being too much to handle for the Bengals' makeshift O-line. This won't be the case tomorrow. I think the Eagles' O-line will be able to handle the Chiefs' front-4, giving Jalen Hurts time to fine AJ Brown or Devonta Smith down the field. Ultimately, the Eagles' defense will be able to do enough to slow down Patrick Mahomes, giving the Eagles their 2nd Super Bowl in the last decade with a score of 30-24.  

**Nevin**: Everything inside my brain wants me to go with the Eagles here. They have the better offense with elite talent across the board, and an elite defense filled with elite veteran savvy. Then I look at the Chiefs' roster and see number 15, the MVP Patrick Mahomes. Patrick Mahomes is the best quarterback of the last half-decade, and it's not even remotely close. Making it to the AFC Championship Game every year since the closing seconds of the 2017 season, since Mahomes became a starter, is no easy feat. Mahomes will win his 2nd Super Bowl of an already Hall Of Fame caliber career only in his 6th season by winning against the Eagles 37-34.

### **Travis Kelce over/under 78.5 receiving yards:**

**Hieuton** : *HULK SMASH!* Similar to the Hulk, I will be smashing the over on this one. I like Philadelphia's linebackers in TJ Edwards and Kyzir White, but I do not see them being able to keep Travis Kelce under wraps for the whole game. Even when teams gameplan to stop him, Kelce has always found a way to show up when his team needed him. With a high-scoring game, expect Kelce to make multiple big plays as he tries to help his team beat Jason Kelce's Eagles.  

**Nevin**: After the trade for Tyreek Hill, it became even more evident than it already was that Travis Kelce is the Chiefs' offense. Against the best defense in the league, Travis Kelce put up 98 yards against the San Francisco 49ers in the final weeks of October. As the representative of this offense, there should be no reason why Andy Reid does not scheme up passes to get their best playmaker involved. Everyone should take the over on this one.

### **Gatorade color?**

**Hieuton** : With the potential for rain in Phoenix, I'm gonna count on an icy cold bath of blue Gatorade for Coach Sirianni.   

**Nevin**: Coming from Arrowhead Stadium and playing in the Red Sea, there's nothing more perfect than watching Patrick Mahomes and fellow teammates dispose of perfectly good red Gatorade on Coach Andy Reid.

### **Jalen Hurts over/under 1 touchdown reception:**

**Hieuton** : If I were a Chiefs defensive player, I would be hyper-aware of any formation that looks similar to this iconic play when the Eagles are near the goal line. I do think Philadelphia will call this play sometime tomorrow, but it will be to convert a crucial 3rd/4th down. With Jalen Hurts being the better athlete compared to Nick Foles, this play could actually do some damage when called at the right time. Nevertheless, I'm going with the under on this one.  

**Nevin**: The 'Philly Special' was a remarkable play that has happened a few times since the 2017 event. I can't imagine Steve Spagnuolo won't be prepared to face it. Sirianni is a brilliant coach so I expect him to be one step ahead and not call the inventive play on Sunday. Take the under on a Jalen Hurts touchdown reception.

### **Haason Reddick over/under 1.5 sacks:**

**Hieuton** : I think this one will be one of the deciding factors of the game. The Eagles will most likely have Reddick move around so that he isn't facing Orlando Brown for the whole game, and so that they can get him some matchups against KC's tight ends. The massive free-agent addition has been averaging 1.5 sacks over the past 5 games, and you can expect him to step it up when everything is on the line. Take Reddick to have 3 sacks in tomorrow's game.  

**Nevin**: Haason Reddick was the Eagles' best pass rusher on a loaded defensive line in the 2022 season. The Eagles will attempt to line up Reddick against Andrew Wylie, the worst Chiefs' offensive lineman. This is not a slight to Wylie who is an average tackle himself, but more a sense of respect for the above-average and elite players scattered across the Chiefs' offensive line. I believe Reddick has a favorable matchup and will get the over by recording 2.5 sacks in the game.

### **Patrick Mahomes over/under 19.5 rushing yards:**

**Hieuton** : When the going gets tough, as it inevitably will in this game, you can always count on Patrick Mahomes to take the game into his own hands. But the ankle of #15 will be a factor in this contest. If the Phili defensive front is able to dominate as they've done all season, a still-injured Patrick Mahomes may need to do more scrambling than Andy Reid would like to see. But I think that the Eagles find a way to contain him behind the line of scrimmage. Mahomes will get some small runs here and there, but I feel pretty good about taking the under here.  

**Nevin**: The Chiefs will need to find ways to be creative against one of the NFL's best defenses, and that includes getting their QB to scramble and open up their offense. While Mahomes is still recovering from his high-ankle sprain, one run when the defense has their backs to the ball should be enough for people to go over 19.5 rushing yards for Patrick Mahomes on this prop.

### **AJ Brown over/under 72.5 receiving yards:**

**Hieuton** : L'Jarius Sneed, Joshua Williams, Jaylen Watson, and Trent McDuffie have all seen this monster before. When they faced DK Metcalf in week 16, they allows 7 receptions for 81 yards to the massive Seahawk. Metcalf and Brown are slightly different players, but they both share a massive frame and scary physicality. While the Chiefs will gameplan for the Eagles' top receiver, you will see Brown make some big catches in the 2nd half to try and win the game for his team. I think he has his first 100-yard game since week 15 against the Cowboys.  

**Nevin**: Ever since being traded from the Tennesee Titans who misunderstood the exploding wide receiver market, AJ Brown has been on a roll posting close to 1500 yards and 11 touchdowns on the season. The Chiefs do not have enough star power at DB to cover Brown in the time it takes for their lackluster pass rush to get past an elite Eagles offensive line. The over of 72.5 receiving yards for AJ Brown is the clear option here.

### **Does Gronk make the field goal?**

**Hieuton** : I'm fairly confident that an average person with a few months of practice could make a field goal, given they have the right leg. You can't deny that Gronk has the leg. Bet on him to make the field goal given that he's been training with legendary kicker Adam Vinatieri.  

**Nevin**: Gronkowski was a phenomenal TE for his career. His talents range from on the field to starring in commercials. He never had to worry about kicking because he had Adam Vinatieri for most of his career. There was a reason Gronkowski played offense for his career. He didn't play defense often (Miami Special) and won't play special teams either when he can't make the field goal during the live commercial.

### **Isaiah Pacheco over/under 47.5 rushing yards:**

**Hieuton** : Over. Over. Over. While the Eagles' defense will be focused on stopping the passing attack led by #15, I can see Pacheco picking up some big chunk runs. These will come through draw plays and runs plays run in gun formations. Don't be surprised if Pacheco has a big game in the big game.  

**Nevin**: Against a stout Eagles' defense and an elite defensive line, expecting Pacheco to get under 47.5 rushing yards is reasonable. This game, more likely than not, will come down to the NFL's best player Patrick Mahomes rising up to the occasion to cement himself as one of the best of all time.

### **Mahomes over/under 300 passing yards:**

**Hieuton** : I love Mahomes as much as the next guy, but he has been stopped before. Against the Buccaneers in Super Bowl 55, Mahomes was held to 270 yards and 53% completion rating. He posted a measly 42.2 QB rating in a game the Chiefs lost 31-9. This game should be much closer than that, but I don't think Mahomes has a good day (by his standards) against the Eagles. Give me the under.  

**Nevin**: This game is going to entirely be on how well Andy Reid and the offense can function against a stout defense. The best way to succeed includes putting the ball more often than not in your 2022 MVP's hands. Mahomes will find ways to make plays no matter how the game plays out. The over on 300 Mahomes' passing yards is the most realistic option.

### **Super Bowl MVP:**

**Hieuton** : To me, I think the MVP will go to one of the two props from earlier. A 3-sack Haason Reddick would be a strong candidate if the Eagles' defense can hold Mahomes and the Chiefs to under 20 points, but if the game becomes a high-scoring shootout, AJ Brown with a 100+ yard game could find himself MVP. My final pick is the latter, with AJ Brown making the game-sealing TD on a deep pass from Hurts and a broken tackle on Jaylen Watson.  

**Nevin**: If the Chiefs stay true to my prediction and win this game, Mahomes will be the clear Super Bowl MVP. Chris Jones may have potential, but against an NFL-best Eagles' offensive line, pressure will be hard to come by. Take Mahomes for Super Bowl MVP all the way.
