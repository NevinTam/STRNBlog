**1.5 Will Anderson EDGE**  
Thanks for reading SeahawksToday! Subscribe for free to receive new posts and support my work.  

Will Anderson is one of the highest touted prospects in the entire draft, seen as the elite edge prospect that could change an entire defense. Anderson hails from Alabama, where he has demonstrated his elite athletic traits in speed and size while using great technique to beat opposing offensive linemen. Anderson could be utilized by the Seahawks rushing alongside Uchenna Nwosu, with Darrell Taylor and Boye Mafe serving as the backups. This would give the Seahawks an extremely talented edge duo that could serve for years to come and give the Seahawks a pass rush not seen since their super bowl days.

**Trade: 1.20 for 1.31 and 2.63 (Chiefs)**

**1.31 (Chiefs) Ade Ade DE**

Adetomiwa Adebawore, known as Ade Ade was very recently on a top-30 visit for the Seahawks. Ade Ade is a highly regarded player who has moved up in the draft rankings recently, from the middle of the second round to the end of the first. While he could play as an EDGE, he is better suited as a 3-4 DE due to his strength and agility. The Seahawks have expressed their desire to improve their defensive line, and Ade Ade could be the perfect addition to accomplish this. His speed could provide the necessary pass-rush from the 3T position to reduce double teams for other pass rushers on the team. Ade Ade has the potential to become a Seahawk if he impresses during his visit with the team.

**2.37 Mazi Smith NT**

The Seahawks are currently lacking nose tackles on their roster for week 1. Bryan Mone is on the team, but his performance has been disappointing and he may have been cut if not for his injury. Al Woods was released due to financial reasons, and his play and snaps declined last season due to aging and injury recovery issues. Poona Ford has played well as a starter at nose tackle, but he was out of position as a 3-4 DE. Mazi Smith is a potential starter for the team at nose tackle and could be the answer to their struggles against the run in their new 3-4 formation. He also has the ability to contribute to their pass rush, which is a priority for the team.

**Trade: 2.52 and 4.123 for 2.38 (Raiders)**

**2.38 (Raiders) Joe Tippmann C**

Joe Tippmann is a center out of Wisconsin who has a great duo of power and athleticism. This allows him to stay active while engaging defenders in run blocking, pushing them off the point of attack and creating holes for the running back on the interior. In pass protection he is very quick to mirror defenders movements in small spaces, however at times he has issues gaining leverage against these big defenders in pass blocking. The Seahawks could use another center after Austin Blythe retired and they signed Evan Brown in free agency. Tippmann could challenge Brown for the starting role and if he doesn't win it, stay back and learn for a year before taking the reigns when Brown is a free agent after the season. He could also play guard if needed.

**2.63 (Chiefs) Keanu Benton DE**

Keanu Benton has recently risen on most draft boards and is now projected to go in the mid-to-late 2nd round. Benton is a huge player who will play at 3-4 DE and take the double teams the Seahawks need their bigger players to take to allow others such as Dre'Mont Jones, or Jarran Reed to only face single teams. The defensive line was their biggest hole entering the offseason but if Benton emerges alongside Jones, the Seahawks will have their pair for the next half-decade. Benton would not need to start in week 1 but has the potential to beat out Jarran Reed as the starter as the season progresses and the team realizes the talent Benton has. Benton would play behind Ade Ade as the Seahawks add 2 more 3-4 DEs to their revamped defensive line.

**3.83 Daiyan Henley LB**

Daiyan Henley is the LB from Washington State who looks to be the perfect Seattle defender. Henley excels in coverage and is adequate in the run game, something Seattle has not had in their linebacking core for many years. Wagner, while decent in coverage and elite in the run game, will not be able to play for too many more years at an elite level, resulting in Seattle not hesitating and taking his potential replacement in round 3. Henley will play alongside Wagner and cover up Bobby's flaws which will allow Wagner to mainly focus on the run, his specialty, and Henley on his specialty of being good in coverage. Jordyn Brooks may return from injury and not start immediately if Henley can win the job and not look back, and hope to be Seattle's LB1 the next few years.

**5.154 Roschon Johnson RB**

The Seahawks have needed a power-back since Chris Carson's retirement, and Johnson is the perfect type. As of now, Seattle has 2 running backs on their roster and needs someone who can act as depth and start alongside Walker. Ken is the perfect speed player who can take the ball outside and score the homerun play, but Johnson would be the perfect player who can muscle his way for the extra yard on 3rd and 1. Dallas could act as the 3rd down back, or if Johnson develops more as a pass-catcher he could be Seattle's running back on 3rd down, making Dallas a key veteran depth piece that can play on special teams.

**Trade: 6.198 for 7.257 and 2024 6th (Panthers)**

**7.237 Evan Hull RB**

While the Seahawks just picked RB with their last pick, having 3 running backs on a roster still is not enough for a team that only has a functioning offense if their running backs produce. Hull has strong vision and knows when to turn the ball upfield. He is anything but a power back, but after drafting Johnson the team needs a clear backup to Walker that can imitate his style. Hull has an elite acceleration that is dangerous if he gets open in space, or if he catches check-downs in college, something he did often. Hull would make the roster purely based on special teams and could play a few snaps every game, or be fine sitting as the RB4 on the depth chart of an RB-needy team.

**7.257 (Panthers) Alex Ward LS**

The Seahawks have yet to sign an LS to their roster yet. The Seahawks spend one of the last picks in the draft on the only long snapper that will get drafted, in hopes of finding a decade-long Hall All-Pro Hall of Famer-esque player that can make Seattle never have to worry about the position ever again. Ott has been good for Seattle but with his recent injuries and Tinker also having a bad snap every so often, Seattle chooses to address long snapper with their last pick of the draft and cement the position for decades to come.
