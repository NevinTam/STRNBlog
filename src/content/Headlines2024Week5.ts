**Seahawks OL vs Giants DL**
‎ 
The Seahawks OL played their best game of the season against a strong Lions defensive line headlined with Aidan Hutchinson. However, most of this can be credited to Geno Smith who got the ball out efficiently and fast. And, Aidan Hutchinson recorded the most pressures of any player this season in a single game against the Lions, but failed to record a sack. Against the Giants, the Seahawks should have a better matchup with Brian Burns who has struggled so far this season, Kayvon Thibodeaux who has been very inconsistent in his career, and Dexter Lawrence who is one of the best DTs in the NFL. The IOL should have a hard matchup against Lawrence, but the tackles of Cross and Forysthe should be able to hold their own. This is a game where if Seattle can establish the run, Geno Smith could have another strong outing through the air and get the ball to many of Seattle's playmakers.

**Seahawks DL vs Giants OL**
‎ 
The Seahawks will have Uchenna Nwosu back this game for the first time this regular season. However, Byron Murphy II and Boye Mafe have been ruled inactive. Regardless, the Giants offensive line has struggled through the first part of the season and should not have an easy matchup against a pass rush that performed well against the Lions and is now adding back their best EDGE pass rusher and best DT pass rusher. Mafe is a big contributor for this team, but Hall has stepped up for the team along with decent production from Dre'Mont Jones, so this team should be ready to pressure Daniel Jones. Leonard Williams is still top 20 in pressures even after only playing around half of the season so far. Except Williams to have a good game against his former team as he returns to the team after missing most of week 3 and all of week 4. Evan Neal, Giants OL, is a player the Giants chose to draft over Charles Cross, the Seahawks OT who has looked borderline elite thus far.

**Giants Secondary vs Seahawks WRs**
‎ 
Against the Lions, the Seahawks passing game was elite. Geno Smith put almost 400 yards of passing and had career highs in attempts, completions, and passing yards. The Giants secondary is headlined by Deonte Banks, Dru Phillips, and Nick McCloud. Banks has not had a good season so far, allowing 64% of targets to be receptions while also giving up 4 TDs and 234 yards for a 134 passer rating allowed. With the amount of talent the Seahawks receiving corps has, this should be a good game from Geno Smith if the OL can hold up against the Giants pass rush. Walker and Charbonnet could have good games on the ground as well as through the air. DK could also extend his 100-receiving-yard game streak to 4 in a row atfer posting 104 receiving yards 2 games in a row. Metcalf, Lockett, and JSN have been used throughout this season, and it's hard to predict who will have the better game among them. Regardless, the Seahawks should be able to move the ball fairly well against a weaker Giants team.
