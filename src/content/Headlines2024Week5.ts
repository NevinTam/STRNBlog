**Seahawks DL vs Lions OL**
‎ 
The Seahawks DL has been one of the best in the NFL through 3 weeks. However, the team has the chance to be missing 5 of its starting 6 front-7 players, including their 4 best pass rushers (Nwosu, Mafe, Williams, and Murphy) all already being ruled out. This leaves the likes of Hall, who has been good through 3 weeks, Jones, who played perhaps his best game as a Seahawk last week, Reed, who also played his best game of the season last week, Hankins, also played his best game as a Seahawk last week, and Morris who has not played too much. Most of these players, though, were backups for the first 2 weeks of the season and once injury took place, became starters and performed well.

It appears that the Seahawks depth on the defensive line is extraordinary where their backup linemen were placed into a starting role and played good. On the other side of the ball, the Lions have one of the best offensive lines in the NFL. However, Frank Ragnow, one of the best centers in the NFL, has already been ruled out this game. Still, an elite offensive line against a backup defensive line, albeit one that played like starters last game, is still not a favorable matchup for the Seahawks. Expect the defense to need to be able to cover longer to allow their pass rush to develop. To make up for a lack of pressures, the Seahawks could look to lots of linebacker and cornerback blitzes.

**Lions Secondary vs Seahawks WRs**
‎ 
The Seahawks have utilized all of their wide receivers mostly fairly this season. Lockett, Metcalf, and JSN have all had bigger games and quiet games. Even with this, all of the 3 wide receivers have been involved in each game to somewhat of an extent. The Lions secondary has not been that good through 3 weeks, allowing 236 passing yards on average per game. Also, Brian Branch was added to the injury list as doubtful with an illness after not initially being on it heading into the game. Branch may be the Lions best player in the secondary, and would be a major loss for a team that has already had their struggles defending the pass.

Carlton Davis has not had a good season thus far, allowing almost 70% of targets to be completions, including allowing an 112 passer rating. Terrion Arnold, the other Lions starting outside cornerback, had allowed 146 yards or around 49 yards per game. The Seahawks WRs are expected to provide a difficult challenge for the Lions secondary, but if the Seahawks offensive line does not hold up, the Seahawks won't be able to capitalize on a good matchup against a struggling secondary. Otherwise, if the offensive line does hold up, the Seahawks should have success through the air against a team that they've had lots of success scoring points in the last few years.
