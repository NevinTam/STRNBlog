**Seahawks OL vs Dolphins DL**
‎ 
The Seahawks come across their worst run-blocking performance of the season, with Zach Charbonnet only accumulating 38 yards on the ground. They also were bad at pass-blocking, though Charles Cross looks to be the best pass-blocking OT in all of football. The Dolphins offense struggled greatly against the Bills, even before starting QB Tua left. The Dolphins have been sacked 5 times, and a struggling offense and a struggling defense put the game may have put the game out of reach for them. Furthermore, the Dolphins have only recorded 7 presures this season (31st). The Seahawks have allowed lots of pressures this season, ranking 31st in pass-block-win-rate. This matchup in terms of pass protection could be who can capitalize more on the other side of the ball's mistakes. 

Meanwhile, the Seahawks are expected to not have Ken Walker or George Fant this week. This means that Zach Charbonnet and likely Stone Forsythe will be getting the start at RB1 and RT, respectively. Charbonnet looked fine, but with nearly no run-blocking, the team could never get the run game going. Stone Forsythe played better against the Patriots than he did against the Broncos, but that was more with how badly he played against the Broncos. The weak point of the Seahawks is, once again, their interior offensive line. Connor Williams has gotten better each week and beside from a few bad plays against the Patriots, he looked really good. The rest of the Seahawks IOL is made up of Laken Tomlinson, Anthony Bradford, and Christian Haynes. If these 3 players somehow managed to muster top 20 offensive line play, the Seahawks offensive could probably be top 5-7. Tomlinson has had some really bad plays this season, but has no competition to stress losing his starting job. Haynes and Bradford are battling, but neither standing out. This is a battle between a bad offensive line and a bad defensive line.

**Seahawks DL vs Dolphins OL**
‎ 
The Seahawks DL has been one of the best in the NFL through 2 weeks. The Dolphins offensive line has faced injuries, but star LT Terron Armstead is expected to be back this game. In week 1, the Seahawks were elite at stopping the Broncos RB, but greatly struggled against the Patriots RBs. OC Mike McDaniel will attempt to throw misdirection at the Seahawks in the run game with RB Devon Achane leading the charge. If the Seahawks have not reevaluated their run game performance and scheme from last week, expect the Dolphins to be able to run all over the Seahawks this game.

As a pass-rushing unit, the Seahawks have had a different story this season. According to PFF, they lead the NFL in pressures and PFR says they're near the top of the league. This is a defensive line that is able to get pressure without being blitzed extraordinarily much, which is something that could likely happen against a Dolphins team that is starting Skylar Thompson who is known for holding on to the ball. As long as the Seahawks are able to succesfully and consistently stop the Dolphins running game, the Seahawks should be able to get lots of pressures with hopes to post more sacks this week.

**Dolphins CBs vs Seahawks WRs**
‎ 
The Dolphins starting cornerbacks are familiar CB Jalen Ramsey and Kendall Fuller. Fuller, approaching 30, allowed almost a 70% completion percentage last year and 651 yards on the Commaanders. Ramsey, now on the Dolphins, has so far this season allowed a 100% completion percentage on 3 targets for a grand total of 54 yards, including allowing a perfect 158.3 passer rating. Ramsey is also approaching 30, and is still a top CB in the game, however. This will continue to be a hard matchup for DK after facing Patrick Surtain II, Christian Gonzales, and now Jalen Ramsey. DK Metcalf can likely win this matchup with Ramsey, but it will be a tough matchup nevertheless.

Tyler Lockett was the 3rd/4th option last week after posting a team high receiving yards in week 1. Fuller should have a hard time being able to consistently cover Lockett and JSN throughout this whole game. JSN will most likely be looking to build on top of a breakout game last game, posting 100+ yards for the first time in his NFL career. This is a matchup that will also depend on how well the Seahawks offensive line can hold up against a Dolphins pass rush that ranks 31st in pressures this season according to PFR. Establishing the run game to set up the pass game and keep the defensive linemen unable to predict plays will allow the passing game to open up.
