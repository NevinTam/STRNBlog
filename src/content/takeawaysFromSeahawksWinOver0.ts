**Geno Smith**  
Thanks for reading SeahawksToday! Subscribe for free to receive new posts and support my work.  

Geno Smith officially had his career game, posting 367 yards. He has already topped his career-high season in yards, with 3169. His previous high was 3046 in his first season. There's not much more to say; Geno Smith has lit up the league in one of the best Cinderella stories in the entire NFL. Giving Lockett and Metcalf 100 yards each, Geno had bullet point accuracy, posting his 9th game above 69% accuracy. He got 8 different receivers involved for an average of 13 yards per completion, the 4th highest for QBs who played every snap in week 13. Smith leads the NFL with 9 games with a 100+ pass rating, more than Wilson or any Seattle quarterback had in any season. He also is on a streak of 6 games with a 100.0 passer rating, tying Wilson for the franchise record. Number 2 on games with a 100+ passer rating, is reigning Super Bowl loser, Joe Burrow. If Geno continues his streak of games with a 100+ passer rating for the remainder of the season, he will have tied Aaron Rodgers's NFL-best 2020 season of 14 games with a 100 passer rating. Geno Smith is on a roll, and don't be surprised if he ends up as Comeback Player of the Year, or more unlikely yet deservedly, MVP. Most Seahawk fans, including myself, advise the Seahawks to avoid drafting a QB with their draft picks next year knowing Geno Smith would be a clearcut MVP candidate if his defense allowed them to win more games.

**Running Backs and Injury**

The Seahawks are down to their final running backs. Rashaad Penny was their starting back entering the season but had a season-ending injury. Kenneth Walker didn't play in week 1 but played every game since then, however, exited early with an unusual ankle injury. Travis Homer suffered an injury in a previous game and thus was never suited for the game in SoFi Stadium. DeeJay Dallas stepped in for Walker against the Rams and promptly got sent to the blue tent and played very limited snaps for the rest of the game. That led to Tony Jones Jr., the last running back on the Seahawks roster to start for the remainder of the game. All Seattle fans had a scare once Jones took time to get up after a large hit, but Jones later revealed his contacts got knocked out on the hit, and he played the rest of the game near-blind, without either of his contacts. The Seahawks did sign veteran Wayne Gallman to the practice squad. The former Giant remained unsigned and had his best career game against the Seahawks in 2020.   

RB Room Entering the Season:

RB1: Rashaad Penny

RB2: Kenneth Walker III

RB3: Travis Homer

RB4: DeeJay Dallas

Potential RB Room entering Week 14

RB1: Wayne Gallman

RB2: Tony Jones Jr.

The Seahawks need to hope one of the injured running backs can be healthy enough to play against the Panthers, or else they will need all the help they can get against a franchise with most of its key pieces on defense.

**DK Metcalf and Tyler Lockett**

With DK and Lockett's explosive games of 127 and 128 yards, respectively, both are now on track to amass 1100 yards on the season. DK and Lockett are on set to make up the third instance where multiple receivers amassed 1000 yards in franchise history. The first time was Brian Blades and Joey Galloway in 1995. The second time was DK Metcalf and Tyler Lockett in 2020. In no other years of the Seahawks' franchise have there been multiple receivers with 1000 yards in one season. This shows how amazing this duo is, but what could have made them more special was if DK Metcalf got 33 more yards in 2021 and 100 more yards in 2019, every year that their careers have overlapped would have resulted in them both being 1000-yard receivers. The streak of 1000+ yards could have been 4 years, much longer than the previous streak of 1 year in 1995. Expect Metcalf and Lockett to have a slightly harder time against a stout Carolina Secondary.

**Run Defense**

For starters, all Rams' running backs were limited to under 4 yards per carry. Other Rams were able to manage more than 4 yards per carry, but they were either wide receivers or quarterbacks. The longer run by any player was Brandon Powell's 20-yard run. The longest run by a running back was Cam Akerks with 13. In other words, the Seahawks vastly improved on the ground in terms of average. In actual quantity, they also improved going from an average of 218 yards allowed to running backs in the last 2 games, to 69 yards to Cam Akers and Kyren Williams for an average of 3.5 yards per attempt. The Seahawks have been using Cody Barton much more on the field in the last 3 games than they have during any time during their win streak. The Seahawks will be going against a Panther's team that after trading star running back Christain McCaffrey has seemingly gotten better at the position in terms of statistical value. The Panthers have had 4 of 6 games where they have had 100-yard rushers, since the McCaffrey trade. They won 3 of those 4 games, with the sole loss coming to the Falcons in overtime, with multiple missed kicks by the Panthers, one due to a penalty has drawn on DJ Moore in the near game-sealing touchdown, for taking his helmet off.

**Cody Barton**

Comparing the former Bobby Wagner understudy from 2 years ago to now, Barton looks to have become a decent player. After struggling in coverage, a surprising failure knowing he was a former safety, Barton has become a sufficient player in coverage. Recording his second career interception, both coming in the last 3 games, Barton seems to have a better understanding of the scheme and is communicating well with Brooks. After allowing 200 yards even in the first 7 weeks of the year, or a 29-yard per game average, in the last 5 weeks he has allowed a total of 80 yards, or 16 yards per game. The Seahawks' run game has drastically changed from prior weeks to the last 3 games. For reference, around 40 snaps per game for Barton in their 4-game winning streak, but in the last 3 weeks around 65. Inversely, without the linebacker on the field, we are better at stopping the run. Since the start of our 4-win streak, our worst games defending the run have been in our last 3 games, coincidentally the games Barton has played the most snaps in. Barton still needs to develop in run defense, and more importantly, getting off blocks. Too many plays where opposing ball carriers run for long distances Barton is seen stuck on a block with a running back. The reason we are playing him is most likely because of his improved coverage skills, but if this defense wants to go the distance in the playoffs, Barton will need to be a more well-rounded player, or the Seahawks might go back to their personnel without Barton.
