The Seahawks might be nothing more than an average team at the end of the 2022 season.

And that's okay.

The Seahawks beat the expectations of [many](https://betiq.teamrankings.com/articles/nfl-preseason-predictions-2022-win-totals-standings-playoff-odds/#:~:text=2022%20NFL%20Preseason%20Rankings%20%20%20%20Rank,%20%200.6%20%2028%20more%20rows%20)(and I mean [many](https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/34420327/nfl-power-rankings-2022-preseason-1-32-poll-hot-seat-watch-coaches-players#SEA)). They are on the brink of even making the playoffs amid the NFC wild card race. They built upon one of the single best offseason in franchise history, maybe one of the best in the history of the NFL.

They rebuilt their coaching staff defensively after promoting Clint Hurtt to defensive coordinator, hiring DC candidate Sean Desai as an associate Head Coach, and hiring Karl Scott. While the results have varied at times this season, at their best the defense has played like a top 10 unit. On the offensive side of the ball, the Seahawks also promoted Andy Dickerson to the offensive line coach, which has been part of the improved play of the offensive line this season, especially in pass blocking.

The Seahawks also had a great free agency, resigning QB Geno Smith to a one-year prove it deal on which he has exceeded expectations tremendously, playing at a pro-bowl level throughout the season and at times carrying the Seahawks offense when the run game has fallen short. The Seahawks also picked up OLB Uchenna Nwosu on a 2 year, $20 million deal who has recorded 9 sacks while playing a majority of edge snaps in an improper rotation. They also resigned TE Will Dissly, who has been a big part of the Seahawks tight end usage, being a good blocker with also the ability to pick up chunk plays for first downs when open. DT Al Woods has continued to be great on the interior as he continues to swallow up ball carries for a loss, stopping them in their tracks and throwing them back with incredible force.

The real gem on top of the Seahawks offseason that set up their future came with the (at the time) [controversial](https://www.tmz.com/2022/03/09/russell-wilson-broncos-trade-seahawks-ben-baller-drew-lock-nfl/)deal to trade quarterback Russell Wilson, the best player on the Seahawks, and a 5th round pick to the Broncos for a massive draft pick haul in addition to QB Drew Lock, DL Shelby Harris, and TE Noah Fant. Fant and Harris have been important parts of the team since the trade, as Fant has established himself as the starting tight end and Harris has shown his ability to rush the passer and create plays with limited snaps in a rotation. Lock was seen as a likely candidate to become QB1 but after preseason has been the backup QB to Geno Smith.

The added draft capital that the Seahawks got in this trade has led to one of the best draft classes for the Seahawks in the last 10 years, where they were able to draft 2 starting offensive tackles, Abraham Lucas and Charles Cross, who are both playing at an above average level. They also drafted Kenneth Walker III, who is second in rookie-rushing totals and is nearing 1000 rushing yards and 10 touchdowns. The Seahawks drafted 2 cornerbacks in later rounds who have had a tremendous impact on the team, with Tariq Woolen tied for first in interceptions and being one of the leading candidates for the DROY award and Coby Bryant playing better and better in the slot cornerback position while being ranked second in the league for force fumbles. They also drafted pass-rusher Boye Mafe who has made a case for getting more snaps after making big contributions in recent weeks on limited snaps. Such a star-studded rookie class making this much meaningful contributions can only lead us to wonder what they will do in the future given more time to hone their skills.

While the Seahawks have had a great offseason, and have a promising prospect of making the playoffs, especially for a young, hungry team like the Seahawks is interesting, they just aren't at that point to be a championship contender with holes on both offense and defense.

And, again, that's okay.

These Seahawks have overcome losing 2 of their best players in franchise history and have come out with a much, much brighter future than anyone would have anticipated at the beginning of the season, with huge contributions from rookies and even more high-draft capital for 2023 coming courtesy of the Denver Broncos. While I'm not saying to completely disregard and give up hope for the 2022 Seahawks season, I think it's fine after seeing a big run given up or another 3-and-out to tip your head back and think of Georgia DL Jalen Carter or Alabama OLB Will Anderson in a Seahawks jersey in eight months.
