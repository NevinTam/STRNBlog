**Offense is Explosively Inconsistent**
This game on offense could very easily be an example of how the Seahawks' season has gone thus far. They had some extreme peaks, with huge successes from Geno Smith and Jaxon Smith Njigba behind a penalty-ridden and porous offensive line. JSN on his first target tipped the ball into the hands of a Rams defender in the first quarter, giving the Rams great field position. However, following this, JSN single-handedly had over 180 yards of total offense, and could easily have had over 250 if not for a pair of penalties. He was instrumental in the Seahawks offensive gameplan and had likely his best game of his young career thus far. Similarly, Geno had great flashes this game, throwing for over 300 yards and 3 touchdowns, but also 3 costly interceptions including one that was returned for a pick-six. These inconsistencies, complemented by a struggling offensive line that did not support any run game, made moving the ball sporadic and dependent on the connection between 2 players all game. This ultimately doomed the Seahawks late in OT where they were not able to convert a short-yardage situation, leading the Rams game-ending touchdown drive.

**Defense Holds up - For the most part**
The Seahawks defense played much improved in this game following their embarrassment against the Buffalo Bills. They were able to stop the run for what seemed like the first time in over a month of football. They were mostly able to limit the passing attack of Cooper Kupp and Puka Nacua (before he was ejected). They were able to re-establish their pass-rush with pressure coming from both edge and the interior, something that was lacking in previous weeks. However, following overtime, they started to break down, with several long completions in the final fateful drive, including two on CB Tariq Woolen, who made his way back from an ankle injury last week. Heading into the bye, the Seahawks are in a precarious must win situation against the rival 49ers if they want to have any chance of making the post-season.
