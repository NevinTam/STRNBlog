**Seahawks Pass Defense vs Panthers QB Andy Dalton**

The Seahawks pass defense is coming off two rough weeks against the Lions and Rams, and might get lit up again against backup QB Andy Dalton, who is replacing rookie QB Bryce Young, who is out with an ankle injury. Young and Dalton offer differing skillsets that dramatically change the playstyle of the offense.

Young, being a much younger (ha ha) quarterback, has not yet fully acclimated to the NFL level and has not gained the ability to completely read defenses or developed the quick thinking needed to play yet. However, Young has great athleticism and a booming arm that led to the reason why he was taken by the Panthers at #1. Dalton is the opposite, with regressing athleticism at 36 and was always more of an immobile quarterback anyway in his prime. However, Dalton has been a veteran within the league for over a decade, and can easily read a field and a defense.

Veteran quarterbacks like Dalton have hounded the Seahawks in the past. Dalton himself has played and beaten the Seahawks many times in the past, and seeks to do it again now on the Panthers. The Seahawks have trouble with veteran QBs such as these as they are able to exploit the soft zones that Seattle has been accustomed to using in the past few years. This likely makes it even more difficult to play a QB like Dalton than Young, as Dalton could easily pick apart the Seahawks defense using short passes.

To mitigate this, the Seahawks may opt to be more aggressive and use the blitz more, which is a trend they have repeated more than usual after two weeks. They are especially using DB blitzes frequently, which was unusual in the past. If safety Jamal Adams is active (currently questionable), the Seahawks could use even more targeted blitzes to keep the short passing game in check.

**Seahawks OL vs Panthers Pass Rush**

The Seahawks OL had a great rebound game against the Detroit front of Aidan Hutchinson and James Houston (who to be fair, should have gotten more pass rushing opportunities). The play of tackles Abraham Lucas and Stone Forsythe was good enough to keep Geno upright for almost the entire game and allowed him to pick apart a suffering Detroit Secondary.

However, now the offensive line as a unit must face a much tougher pass rush, featuring stars like Brian Burns and Derrick Brown, who could give trouble for the offensive line. To make matters worse, the Seahawks may be missing RG Phil Haynes, who is questionable. This would be just another hit for an already injured offensive line, which could be missing 3 starters already in Week 3.

To remedy this, the Seahawks may employ a similar strategy to last week, featuring more tight-end sets and short passing from Smith, which proved extremely effective against Detroit. However, this would limit the rushing game and not provide key opportunities for rookies like Jaxon Smith Njigba and Zach Charbonnet. Once the offensive line injuries clear up, it will be interesting to see what OC Shane Waldron's full vision for the offense including all the new assets.

**Seahawks WRs vs Panthers CB Group**

The Seahawks have one of the most feared receiving groups of the NFL, consisting of All-Pro DK Metcalf, most-reliable Tyler Lockett, and first-round draft pick Jaxon Smith-Njigba. The Panthers have CJ Henderson and Donte Jackson starting for them after Jaycee Horn has been held out due to injury. Seattle should be able to win this matchup if they have a protected pocket that can keep Geno Smith clean enough for him to connect to his star wide receivers. DK and Lockett have a strong chance to go for 100 yards, while Jaxon can beat up against a Panthers LB core missing their star Shaq Thompson. JSN should be able to be a reliable 3rd down target, winning in the middle of the field while DK and Lockett get doubled outside the numbers. The only way this doesn't happen is if the Seahawks continue to use JSN the way they have been, most likely due to easing him back from injury, and he rarely runs routes that leave the backfield, not allowing him to play to his strengths in using his proficient route-running skills to beat the Panthers linebackers.

**Seahawks Pass Rush vs Panthers OL**

The Seahawks were expected to have a strong pass rush entering this season with Uchenna Nwosu, Dre'Mont Jones, Jarran Reed, and Darrell Taylor. But after two weeks, only one sack has been achieved by a non-secondary player. The Panthers have a stout offensive line headlined by Ikem Ekwonu, Bradley Bozeman, and Taylor Moton. The Seahawks have struggled to get any interior pressure this season, which has cost their EDGEs who have not been able to produce. The Panthers have a much weaker IOL than tackle group, but it won't make too much a difference against a weak Seattle IDL pass rush. The Seahawks will have to get pressure to avoid allowing QB Andy Dalton from picking apart the Seattle secondary, which has occurred in the past few weeks playing veteran QBs Matthew Stafford and Jared Goff.
