**Offense Starts to Click**

Geno Smith had another signature game (something we’ve been accustomed to), throwing for near 400 yards in another Detroit shootout. He played near perfect for 3 quarters until the deficit became too much to handle, forcing him to make downfield throws in a constant rushed state. He was able to connect with DK Metcalf on multiple chunk plays while converting key 3rd downs with receptions to JSN and Lockett. Geno has clearly cemented himself as a top-tier QB despite his TD-INT ratio, which has been partially due to tipped balls.

Kenneth Walker also had an incredible game in his return, showcasing his elite agility on multiple eye-opening plays, including one where he flipped twice. He finished with 3 touchdowns and close to a 100 yards rushing. The balance between Charbonnet and Walker has been duly missed, with Walker providing an elite rushing ability unlike almost any other player in the league. Charbonnet was also key in this game as a receiver and a pass-blocker, providing Smith with valuable time to launch the ball downfield.

The offensive line held up better this week, even with the added pressure of going against star DE Aidan Hutchinson. The Lions got quite a bit of pressure, especially on the edge. Smith was able to only take 3 sacks on over 50 dropbacks, however, which was essential to managing the offense.

**Defense Struggles with Missing Players**

The Seahawks were down their entire starting defensive line this game, and it showed. While the Seahawks still got lots of pressure in this game, with 11 pressures on 18 dropbacks, it was tough to threaten Goff due to coverage busts and the constant threat of the run game. The rushing game was what really struggled in wake of injuries, which forced the Seahawks to play more aggressive defenses, leading to plenty of YAC and open receivers, especially in the intermediary area.

Derrick Hall and Jarran Reed were the main defensive players on the line that had impacts. Reed started the game with a sack and notched 2 pressures this game, along with Hall who had a sack and 2 pressures. Hall has come into his own this year and really helped lengthen the depth on what was beforehand a short-handed edge rotation.

Most of the coverage busts came (like said previously) from the intermediate area where the box safety and LBs played. Dodson did not have a particularly great game in coverage, and K’Von Wallace allowed a huge touchdown catch to Jameson Williams along with multiple huge catches allowed to Amon Ra St. Brown. Devon Witherspoon had a good game in coverage, but his lack of size finally came up this game with some missed tackles late in the game.
