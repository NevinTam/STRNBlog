**Lions EDGE Group vs. Seahawks OTs**

Following the Seahawks loss to the Rams last week, the Seahawks lost both starting tackles in Abraham Lucas and Charles Cross after they exited in the second half. Lucas was then later placed on IR, ruling him out for at least the next 4 weeks, while Cross has already been ruled out for the Lions game. This means that likely the starting duo will be Jake Curhan and Stone Forsythe, with a possibility that newly acquired LT Jason Peters could be starting instead of Forsythe if he is able to play so early after being signed. Curhan has started on the Seahawks during the 2021 season, specifically during the second half surge the Seahawks had then, becoming a rushing juggernaut behind the emergence of Rashaad Penny. Curhan was a key part of this, leveling several key blocks that sprung some huge Penny runs. This will hopefully translate to next game for him after a sub-par performance in pass-protection last week. Forsythe was the final pick in the Seahawks infamous 2021 draft where the Seahawks had a league-low 3 picks. He hasn't had much serious game experience but did not look great after Cross left the game. He should have a better opportunity to get ready against the Lions with more preparation, hopefully showcasing his skills if given the opportunity.

On the other side of the ball, the Lions have edge rush duo Aidan Hutchinson and James Houston, both second year players that totaled over 17 sacks last season as rookies. Last week, while they were not able to sack Mahomes, they put plenty of pressure on the defending champions to limit the KC offense, which will be a big issue for the Seahawks seeing how they played against pressure after the offensive line broke down late in the Rams game.

**Lions Secondary vs. Seahawks WRs**

The Seahawks WR group, while extremely talented, struggled to get open against a weaker Rams secondary. This cannot continue against a talented Lions secondary led by S Chauncey Gardner Johnson, who has served as a defensive leader for the team. Metcalf and Lockett must get open more for the offense to remain consistent after the group (including JSN), combined for just 70 yards.

Speaking of JSN, the hope is that he gets more involved this week against the Rams. He had a few manufactured catches for him through WR screens, but unfortunately was not able to make a big impact on the game. Hopefully he will be able to make a much bigger impact from the slot against Brian Branch, who made several big plays against the Chiefs, namely returning a pick-six against Mahomes that became the main difference in a tightly contested Week 1 game.

Outside receivers DK Metcalf and Tyler Lockett must also matchup against CBs Jerry Jacobs and Cameron Sutton, who were able to shut down the Chiefs receiving corps last week. Metcalf has had a history of playing well against the Lions in their past few meetings, which will be needed after a lackluster performance.

**Seahawks Pass Rush vs. Lions Offensive Line**

The Lions have had one of the best offensive lines in the league or the past few years, and showed it last week against the Chiefs, keeping QB Jared Goff upright as he was able to complete passes downfield. The Seahawks will have to do better than they did last week against one of the lower-ranked offensive lines in the league. They were able to only three pressures against Stafford, allowing him to stay back in the pocket and pick them off over the middle. The Seahawks must ensure this doesn't happen again against a much better offensive line.

Specifically, the Seahawks lacked a lot of pressure from the interior, from their new additions in Dre'Mont Jones, Mario Edwards, and Jarran Reed. On the interior, the Lions feature Pro-bowl caliber C Frank Ragnow, LG Jonah Jackson, and RG Halapoulivaati Vaitai. Interior pressure will be key to slowing down Goff and overall performance will be key to stopping the Lions dual rushing threat with David Montgomery and Jahmyr Gibbs, who could get an increased role following his explosive carries last week.

**Seahawks Secondary vs. Lions WRs.**   

The Lions wide receiver core is headlined by slot aficionado WR Amon-Ra St. Brown and WR Josh Reynolds. Marvin Jones Jr. is also in the bunch but Brown is the one in the end the Seahawks defense should be most worried about. The Seahawks struggled last week against a weak Rams' receiving core, allowing 100+ yards to both Puka Nacua and Tutu Atwell. While the hope is that week one was a fluke, there's no reason the Lions receivers will not continue to exploit the middle of the field, the area the Seahawks are weakest at defending.

Scheme-wise, the Seahawks have problems defending in zone coverage, especially in the middle of the field, because they play off the wide receiver and cannot react in time when they catch the ball for 30 yards. Unless Seattle irons out their scheme to play more aggressively, they will have a tough time defending these wide receivers who seem to be elite when facing the Seahawks. The debut of top-5 draft pick CB Devon Witherspoon, who can play both in the slot and outside, should help the Seahawks secondary. If Witherspoon can play shutdown against Amon-Ra St. Brown, the Seahawks will have a good chance to be lockdown against a weak receiving core outside of Brown.
