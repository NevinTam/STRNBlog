**Seahawks WRs vs Rams Secondary**

With the departure of Jalen Ramsey, the Rams secondary has not played up to the same standard. While they did play well at the beginning of the season, especially during their blowout against the Seahawks, they have not been great to opposing WRs since. CBs Ahkello Witherspoon (former Seahawk legend!) and CB Duke Shelley are the slated starters for today's game. It will be important for the Seahawks extremely talented WR core to exploit this matchup and win the game through the air. Look for the Seahawks to continue their usage of the screen-game with JSN, especially if the Rams look to put heavy pressure on Geno (specifically on 3rd down) as has been the case for the past few games by opposing teams.

**Rams Pass Rush vs Seahawks Pass Protection**

Headlined by All-Pro Aaron Donald, the Seahawks must attempt to mitigate pressure on Smith, who has performed badly against pressure all season. Look for the Seahawks to again utilize heavy play-action to benefit Smith as he looks to take deeper shots against a weaker secondary. To provide ample time, it will be up to the interior offensive line, with Guards Damien Lewis, Phil Haynes, and Center Evan Brown. Rookie Byron Young has had an incredible rookie season, already tacking up 5 sacks, and is easily one of the best defensive rookies this year. The Seahawks will likely use Zach Charbonnet as well to mitigate any potential threats as a 3rd-down pass protector. If the Seahawks are able to mitigate pressure and allow Smith to cook in the kitchen, then they will be able to march down the field.

**Seahawks Secondary vs Rams WR Core**

The Rams WR core has been a pleasant surprise this season, headlined by monster duo Puka Nacua and Cooper Kupp. Puka Nacua was available last time the Seahawks played the Rams, and had well over a 100 yards and several clutch 3rd-down conversions en route to an incredibly efficient Rams offensive performance. Nacua has racked up over 800 yard of receiving and will likely be a headache for Witherspoon and co. Witherspoon was not available in his first game against the Rams, and will likely be a huge part of the defensive game plan to be aggressive on defense. If the Seahawks have less tight coverage, then Stafford will be able to pick them apart like he was able to do during their first meeting.

**Seahawks Pass Rush vs Rams Offensive Line**

The Rams offensive line has played better overall, with quality players like rookie Steve Avila and Kevin Dotson playing better than expected coming into the season. However, the Rams have allowed over a 40% pressure rate on QB Matthew Stafford this season. While Stafford has done a good job at avoiding pressure, it is common sense that the more pressure placed on him, the less the offense will be able to function. It is key that the Seahawks continue their streak of good pass rush after last week, especially from the interior. The addition of Leonard Williams is sure to make a huge impact compared to the meager performance of Week 1. Look for Boye Mafe to continue to make huge waves in the pressure and sack game to force Stafford into more critical errors and disrupt their offensive consistency.
