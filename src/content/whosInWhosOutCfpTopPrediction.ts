Holy cow! What a weekend for college football. Some big giants fell. "Roll Tide" were rolled over by Jayden Daniels and the hungry Tigers in overtime. DJU once again showed the more disappointing side to his game during primetime vs Notre Dame. And Hendon Hooker showed that he is not always "Him" during a rough performance against a phenomenal Georgia defense.

It was also a great week for some of the top prospects in the draft. Returning from injury, Jalen Carter showed that he is still the best IDL in the draft with a dominant performance against a Tennessee O-line that only allowed one sack against Alabama. Isaiah Foskey further cemented his place in the first round by helping the Irish upset Clemson, adding a sack along the way. Kayshon Boutte helped his stock out by having a strong outing against Alabama, putting up 7 receptions (season-high) for 51 yards. Kelee Ringo, who I was not high on during pre-season scouting, played great in a game where he needed to lock down Jalin Hyatt and the rest of Tennessee's explosive receivers, putting in 6 solo tackles and 1 INT.

Now that we are five weeks out from the start of Bowl games, I wanted to give my take on who I think will make it into the CFP as well as who will fall short. I apologize in advance if your team is part of the latter.  

Seed #4: Tennessee

Even with their loss to Georgia last weekend, Tennessee is still an incredibly potent team. I have very little doubt that they can win out, and there aren't many obstacles to them getting in. I think it's a strong possibility that the loser of the Big-Ten game moves out of the top 4. Tennessee has a slightly stronger resume than Ohio State and Michigan, with wins against #7 LSU and #9 Alabama under their belt. They have the firepower in the offense and the talent on the defense to be dangerous to anyone facing them.

Seed #3: TCU

This next game will be a tough one for TCU. #18 Texas will provide a tough test on both sides of the ball, especially on defense. I adore Quinn Ewers as one of the top 3 QBs in the 2023 class, and the Bijan-Worthy combo gives them a great chance to knock TCU out of playoff contention. However I think TCU will come out victorious in the end. They have a balanced offense that will give the Texas D a run for their money, with Duggan and Johnston leading the passing attack while Kendre Miller takes handoffs from the backfield. The Horned-Frog defense has let up a good amount of points this season, but they've shown that they can be stout when they need to. After the Texas game, TCU has a pretty clear path to the Big-12 championship and at least the #4 spot in the CFP.

Seed #2: Ohio State

Led by top draft prospect C.J. Stroud, the Buckeyes have been a mainstay in the CFP picture for the whole season. They haven't had a tough schedule by any means, but they have been able to find different ways to win. Their best wins have been over #20 Notre Dame and #14 Penn State, and if they manage to win out, they will most likely secure the #2 spot. Their biggest obstacle to that comes in the form of the Michigan Wolverines. However, this time the game is being played in Columbus, and snow may not be a factor in who wins. I think the Buckeyes rip Michigan early with the air attack, and then finish them with their dual RBs towards the end. As long as their defense can stay strong for the rest of the season, Ohio State stands a chance at winning the whole thing.

Seed #1: Georgia  
And finally, the team that needs no introduction. The reigning national champions wasted no time in harassing the Tennessee offense on Sunday, with Jalen Carter's return playing a big role in their success. In a game where defense supposedly wins championships, Georgia has the best of the best. There are NFL prospects on every level of the defense. If they continue to shut down opposing teams' receivers, they will be very hard to beat. And I won't forget to mention their QB, Stetson Bennett. If he continues to limit turnovers and hit his deep balls, no one can beat the Bulldogs. Kentucky could prove to be a fickle matchup, and LSU's Jayden Daniels poses a unique problem for any defense, but Georgia can just as easily step over those teams like they did Tennessee.

There are my four teams. Some honorable mentions are Michigan and Oregon, who I think don't have a strong enough team to compete with the top four. I am fairly confident that my top 4 will end up being the top four, but there's a lot more football to be played. Until next time, enjoy all the weekend games. Go Hawks!
