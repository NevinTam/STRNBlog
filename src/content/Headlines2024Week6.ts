**Seahawks OL vs 49ers DL**

Stone Forsythe is a 3rd string right tackle. Nick Bosa is one of the best players in the entire NFL. Even Charles Cross, likely the Seahawks best offensive lineman, has not had a good few games pass-blocking after starting the season without allowing any pressures in the first 2 weeks. Leonard Floyd has also been a valuable contributor for a 49ers defense that is headlined by Nick Bosa. Stone Forsythe has played fine for the Seahawks, but against Aidan Hutchinson, played poorly. Against the 49ers, he’ll have another tough matchup against one of the best defensive lineman in football.

Though there could be a strong matchup for the Seahawks IOL against an injured 49ers IDL that is missing pieces. However, the Seahawks IOL has not shown much to believe that this will be a favorable matchup for the Seattle. If the Seahawks are not able to be a dominant force in the run game against a weak defensive line, it seems unlikely they will be able to for the rest of the season unless they receive upgrades. Being a force in the run game, however, could be the momentum the Seahawks OL needs to become dominant as a unit for the rest of the season.

**Seahawks WRs vs 49ers CBs**
 
Charvarius Ward will not play against the Seahawks on Thursday Night Football. This leaves Deommodore Lenoir as the player who will likely match up against Metcalf. Lenoir has been a valuable contributor for the 49ers against the Seahawks. If the Seahawks OL can hold up, this could be an extremely good game for an extremely talented set of Seahawks receivers. However, with an elite linebacker core headlined by Fred Warner, the middle of the field will likely be hard to target. This could mean smaller games for Lockett and JSN. 

Metcalf should be in line for a strong game against the 49ers who do not have Ward who has been a difficult cornerback for Metcalf to go against so far in his career. Metcalf already has 3 100 yard games this season and is looking to add his 4th against a 49ers team that appears far weaker than it has been in recent years. Lockett and JSN could have good games in the deep game, but with a vaunted 49ers pass rush, the 49ers will likely know that the Offensive Coordinator Ryan Grubb will try to use his personnel in the quick game.

**Seahawks DL vs 49ers OL**
‎  
The Seahawks will have Leonard Williams, Boye Mafe, and Derick Hall for this game. Williams missed the game against Detroit and seemed to have returned from injury a little earlier before he was fully healthy. Mafe missed the game against the Lions and Giants and returns after recording 11 pressures this season in the first 3 weeks, including 9 in the first 2 weeks. Hall has developed into a very talented player and has been the Seahawks main pass rusher this season with injuries occurring to the likes of Uchenna Nwosu among others. 

The 49ers offensive line is headlined by Trent Williams, arguably the best offensive lineman in all of football, and others relatively less-known but still physical players who can provide enough time for Purdy and create enough room in the run game. Trent Williams will likely lock up any player that lines up against him, but the other linemen on the 49ers OL will have a harder time if the Seahawks move their defensive linemen appropriately. This could be a matchup that keeps the Seahawks in this game, even with their own limited offensive line.
