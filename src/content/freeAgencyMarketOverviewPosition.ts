    Seahawks Today Lead Writers: Shrihun Sankepally and Nevin Tamilselvan

The Seahawks currently have 3 starting-caliber tight ends on the roster, all of whom were utilized efficiently during the 2022 NFL season. While I do not think the Seahawks should stray away from their in-house options for older veterans in free agency, it is always smart to understand the tight-end market to always have a backup plan ready. Entailing this introductory statement will be an overview of the 3 biggest free agent tight ends Seattle could offer, and if the 2023 Seattle Seahawks should venture and add someone to their qualified group.

**Dalton Schultz**

Overview: Dalton Schultz is easily the biggest name in this select group of tight ends that Seattle could go after. After being franchised tagged last season, Schultz will be unlikely to receive it once again due to the need for the tag to be available in case Tony Pollard does not sign an extension. Schultz has recorded over 2000 yards in the last 3 seasons, peaking in 2021 with 78 receptions for 808 yards and 8 touchdowns. Only 26, Schultz will understandably be near-impossible for Dallas to resign due to the importance of Tony Pollard

Predicted Contract: 3-year deal worth up to $33 million.

If the Seahawks were to sign Schultz they would most likely attempt to trade Dissly, Fant, or Parkinson, or be open to cutting Parkinson. Schultz would be signed and instantly win the starting TE job over Fant and Dissly.

In the end, I do not expect Schultz to get signed by the Seahawks who do not need to overpay a tight end at already one of their strongest position groups and can happily watch Schultz get signed to a young team that needs a good tight end to push them over the top. If Schultz were to get signed perhaps 2 of Seattle's 3 TEs would need to get traded for valuable draft capital, or else 4 talented tight ends may urge Seattle to run 4 TE sets rather than their dominant 3.   

**Evan Engram**

Overview: Evan Engram was known as the former Giants' first-round pick bust who never became anything special in the Big Apple. Engram has been a decent tight end for most of his career but is notorious for dropping very catchable passes with all Giant fans alike. Even with the drops, Engram in his 5 years with the Giants posted 3 seasons with over 500 yards, the highest total being 722 in his rookie year, and 2 seasons under 500 with his last year in New York being his worst season at 408 yards.

Predicted Contract: 2-year deal valued up to $17 million.

The Seahawks most likely will not be able to sign Evan Engram because Engram posted career highs in Jacksonville with 766 yards and 73 receptions. The Jaguars are building a young and special team and Engram and the Jaguars' Front Office will most likely realize this and attempt to keep Engram for the future. The Seahawks and any other team will most likely have no chance to sign Engram.

Seattle should stay away from Engram even if he makes it to free agency due to his major inconsistency in his career thus far, and the fact that there are 3 quality tight ends ready to start for the Seahawks any given week. While Dissly is coming off an injury, signing Engram and paying 4 TEs is not ideal in any scenario for any team, unless as aforementioned a team wishes to revolutionize the world by running 4 TE sets consistently.

**Austin Hooper**

Overview: Austin Hooper was a 3rd round pick of the Falcons in the 2016 NFL Draft. Hooper is a big-bodied receiver that provides a high pass-catching aspect to his game. Austin's production peaked in his last year with the Falcons where he posted 75 receptions for 787 yards and 6 touchdowns. Since that career year, Hooper went to the Cleveland Browns for 2 years where he posted 2 of the 3 worst years of his career. In fairness, Cleveland did not have a stable situation at quarterback and also was a run-centric team. This last year he joined the Titans who were another run-centric team and posted similar stats to his years prior in Cleveland. He amassed a similar yardage to rookie TE Okonkwo.

Predicted Contract: 1-year deal totaling 5.5 million.

Hooper should be of no interest to Seattle, not only because of their deep tight end room but also because his similarities reign true within Noah Fant, who has at this point in his career much more potential to become a dominant tight end. Signing Hooper could mean the trading of Noah Fant, just 1 year after trading FOR him, a move the Seahawks' offseason plans shouldn't include.

Fant and Hooper are similar because both tight ends are much more dominant pass catchers than run blockers, and have very similar body makeups. Hooper is a Pro Bowl TE but has not been for the last 3 years and has shown zero indication he will continue to be one. Hooper's best chance at rejuvenating his career is heading to a team that is not built around the run, for example, the Titans, the Browns, and to some extent, the Falcons are poor teams for Hooper to consider. Instead, Hooper should go to a team such as the Lions where he can be used as a versatile pass-catching tight end on a high-powered offense that while mainly lives through its 2-headed beast at running back, has strong pass-catching weapons and an above-average quarterback who has been known for favoring tight ends in the past, such as the Rams.

In all likelihood, Seattle will kick the tires on going for any tight ends in free agency, and may perhaps attempt to do the opposite and trade away one of their tight ends if they feel the room is too crowded for all of them to sustain sufficient production. I strongly advise Seattle to keep all their tight ends and not look for any new additions to the room, but it is always smart to understand the options in case an irresistible deal emerges.
