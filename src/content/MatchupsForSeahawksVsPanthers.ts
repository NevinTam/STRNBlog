**1. Tony Jones Jr. and Travis Homer vs Panther's Front-7**

The Seahawks are in critical condition at running back with Penny, Walker, and Dallas, all out. Their only 3 running backs on the active roster are Travis Homer, coming back from a knee injury and expected to be a backup this game, Jones Jr., who ran 7 carries for 14 yards after losing his contacts last game, and Godwin, a practice squad elevation. The Panthers have an imbalanced defensive line with a near-elite Brian Burns and Derrick Brown who is having a breakout year. On the other side, they have a weak linebacker core and have Yetur-Gross-Matos who has struggled as a defensive tackle. I expect the Panther's front to win this matchup as the Seahawks will most likely be unable to overcome their weak running back room.

**2. DK Metcalf and Tyler Lockett vs Jaycee Horn**

The son of Joe Horn, Jaycee is having a breakout season after an on-and-off rookie year. Having only allowed 237 yards in coverage, Horn has been the Panthers' best corner. Horn has allowed 20 yards in coverage, while Metcalf and Lockett have each averaged 68 yards per game. Whatever receiver that is not on Horn should be able to feast against a Panther's defense that has severe holes across the board. Expect Horn to have safety help when in coverage against any of Seattle's WRs. Realistically, the Seattle-savvy veterans will be able to beat Horn, especially since the Panthers only have one strong corner. In this case, Horn will be the one to break against Seattle's top-tier passing attack led by Geno Smith.

**3. Charles Cross and Abraham Lucas vs Brian Burns**

After multiple weeks of the Seahawks being rumored to trade for Brian Burns, the Seahawks will now face the pass rusher with their two rookie tackles. Burns has 25 pressures and 10 sacks on the season. For reference, the Seahawks' star pass rusher Uchenna Nwosu has 9 sacks and 19 pressures. Burns has recorded 6 sacks in the last 6 games, with 2 sacks in the last game alone. Charles Cross has performed admirably with 2 of his 5 sacks allowed on the season in the first game. Abraham Lucas has performed even better than his rookie counterpart, grading out to a 67 PFF grade, or a nearly above-average grade for the 24-year-old. Cross has graded out at a 65 PFF grade, borderline between average and above average. Most likely, veteran Brian Burns will be able to garner immense pressure on the rookie tackle duo, ending up with a sack and a few pressures.

**4. D'Onta Foreman and Chubba Hubbard vs Seahawks Front-7**

The Seahawks have a bad front-7 that struggles find defending the run. At any given play, you can see the linebackers stuck on blocks or 2 man fronts that allow the defensive line to get beat. There isn't too much more to say about this matchup. If the Seahawks continue their 2 man fronts, expect the Panthers, similarly to the Raiders, to run all over them. If they revert back to the fronts that they used during their immaculate 4 game-winning streak, the Panthers should not be able to run against them. The Panthers' offensive line is known for the run-blocking, not pass-blocking, so their game plan should be entirely built upon exploiting a weak Seattle run defense. The Seahawks will need to deploy Boye Mafe, their run-stopping EDGE, on almost all downs if they do want to get ridiculed by a Panthers' offense without Christian McCaffrey and keep their playoff and division-winning hopes alive.
