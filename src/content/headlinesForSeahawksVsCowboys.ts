**Geno Smith vs Cowboys Pass Rush**

After another inefficient offensive performance against the Niners, both QB Geno Smith and OC Shane Waldron put extra emphasis on getting the ball out faster with more quick tempo. Look to see Geno try to beat the Cowboys intense pass rush with more YAC based concepts that focus on the usage of the Seahawks elite WR trio to win their one-on-one matchups in man against the Cowboys corners. Geno is also still suffering from an elbow bruise he had suffered against the Rams, which may further hinder Geno throughout this game. Due to the Seahawks recent defensive struggles against the Niners, they will likely need a great game from Geno to keep them in a winning position

**Seahawks WRs vs Cowboys CBs**

As mentioned earlier, the Seahawks will need a great game from their all-star trio to keep themselves in this game. Rookie Jaxon Smith Njigba has been on a good stretch recently, recording over 40 yards in 6 of the last 7 games. More importantly, JSN has single-handedly been one of the most productive Seahawks in terms of YAC, revitalizing an error-prone screen game in Seattle. Look for him to be even more involved in the YAC game to help the Seahawks 3rd-down efficiency in short-medium yardage situations. DK Metcalf will likely have a tough time against DPOY candidate Daron Bland, who has broken the record for pick-sixes in a single year. Lockett will likely be matched up against former DPOY Stephon Gilmore, who has a good year on a stout Cowboys defense.

**Seahawks Pass Rush vs QB Dak Prescott**

Dak Prescott has been playing like an MVP candidate ever since his performance against the Niners on SNF. For the Seahawks defense to hope to stop him, they will have to generate quick pressure against a staunch Cowboys offensive line. Look for The Seahawks to utilize various stunts and blitzes to keep their offensive line disoriented. After having a couple of off games, Boye Mafe could return to form and disrupt Dak's natural timing, breaking offensive consistency. To account for the loss of Uchenna Nwosu, the Seahawks will continue to use Dre'Mont Jones on the edge to give him more pass rushing opportunities. Jarran Reed, Leonard Williams and Jones will be tantamount to generating pressure on the interior.
