The Seahawks cut DE Roy Robertson-Harris just 5 months after they traded for him. Robertson-Harris, a 31-year-old DE who played for the Jaguars, was traded to Seattle for a 6th-round draft pick in the 2026 NFL Draft. The Seahawks, needing major depth along the defensive line at the time with the inability of players like Mike Morris to emerge, traded for Robertson-Harris to be a rotational depth piece that could provide complementary pass rush production. Robertson-Harris, recording 2 pressures and zero sacks in his time with Seattle last season, struggled majorly to produce numbers on his own, It should be mentioned, though, that Macdonald said that Robertson-Harris had a unique role in the defense that was allowing players like Dre'Mont Jones to have their extremely productive moments during the season. However, with the amount of snaps that Robertson-Harris played, 2 pressures and only helping others produce was not adequate.

Moreover, Robertson-Harris had a non-guaranteed $6.6 million on his contract, which means now that the Seahawks cut him, they save that $6.6 million. To most an obvious cut as the Seahawks look to address their needs in free agency, Robertson-Harris will look to grasp onto another team as he approaches age 32. With the $6.6 million in savings and Robertson-Harris being cut, the Seahawks still have weaknesses along their defensive line depth, especially with Dre'Mont Jones getting cut as well. While these savings do save a significant amount of money, it is important that the Seahawks use the money well and wisely; otherwise, they may not adequately address their flaws and may be left with another overpriced veteran who struggles to contribute to the team.
