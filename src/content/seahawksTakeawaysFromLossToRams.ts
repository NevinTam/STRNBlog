**Offensive Inconsistency**

Throughout the first half of the game, the offense was able to produce points, getting scoring opportunities on all of their drives and managing to keep up an effective rushing attack. However, it is important to note that the Seahawks fell behind on their time of possession within this half (and completely within the second half), which could be a troubling sign heading into next week's game against the Lions. The passing game was not great within the first half, however, which was further accentuated in the second half when the Seahawks were forced to pass as they fell behind the Rams.

Within the second half, the offense completely fell off, completing 1 third down and only having 12 yards of offense against one of the lower-ranked defenses coming into the season. The Seahawks lack of offensive spark killed any chance of a comeback and led them to not being able to do what they usually do best - finish out games. Following the loss of both their tackles for next week, the Seahawks are likely to feel heavy pressure, which will further highlight the consistency problems within the Seahawks offense. This was also a key problem last season throughout games and the season overall, as the Seahawks offense noticeably got worse towards the end of the season.

**Ineffective Pass rush**

The pass rush for the Seahawks was completely ineffective against a bottom-ranked Rams offensive line. The Seahawks new additions on the defensive line in Jarran Reed, Dre'Mont Jones, and Mario Edwards only contributed 1 pressure in total, and overall the team netted 3 pressures against Stafford, allowing him to sit back and pick apart the Seahawks secondary. The Seahawks must ensure that this don't happen next week against a poised Goff who has many weapons at his disposal that could pick apart the Seahawks defense.

While the Seahawks were great at defending the run against the Rams, this trend of starting slow on defense has been repeating for the past 5-6 seasons under Pete Carroll, which has been extremely frustrating given the huge amounts of talent that has been invested within this defense.

**Broken Secondary**

The secondary on Sunday had the worst performance of the entire team last Sunday, getting picked apart by Stafford as he abused the middle of the field and threw tight-window throws to WRs Tutu Atwell and Puka Nacua. While in this case, the linebackers were not the main target of passes today, but rather the secondary, especially outside with Michael Jackson/Tre Brown, Coby Bryant, and Julian Love. Time after time they were being exposed, whether it was zone or man coverage (that seemed to be used more heavily within the second half), but overall the secondary did not play well against the Rams.

However, with the upcoming reunions with rookie CB Devon Witherspoon this week against the Lions and upcoming return of All-Pro caliber SS Jamal Adams within the next few weeks, the secondary should look much different, hopefully alleviating many of the errors that were present
