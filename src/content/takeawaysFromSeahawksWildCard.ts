Geno played well in this game, especially in the first half, in which Geno 11/12 for over 100 yards and a touchdown. In the second half, however, Smith had a key fumble in the 3rd quarter that allowed the 49ers to increase their lead to 2 possessions. Following this Geno had an interception when he tried to force a throw to WR Tyler Lockett in the 4th quarter. Geno played well for his circumstances and will likely be a part of the Seahawks in the 2023!season after the Seahawks have made it clear that they want him back.

**Kenneth Walker III**

Kenneth Walker had a good game, especially in the first half, where he was used heavily on the first touchdown, which was scored on a 7-yard run. Walker's usage in the game declined in the second half, where the Seahawks found themselves down multiple scores and became a one-dimensional passing attack. The rushing performance of Walker, however, was one of the best performances of a running back against the 49ers top ranked run defense.

**DK Metcalf**

DK Metcalf had one of his best games of the whole season this Sunday, recording over 130 yards and 2 touchdowns, including a 50 yard deep touchdown where he beat 49ers CB Chavarious Ward, putting the Seahawks in the lead and helping them keep that lead into the second half. Metcalf's performance against the 49ers only added to his impressive postseason stats, including being tied with Hall-Of-Famer Randy Moss for the second most 50-yard touchdowns in playoff history.

**Defensive-Line**

Overall, the defensive line did not play well against the 49ers. The 49ers averaged 5.5 YPC overall, and the Seahawks allowed several huge rushing gains to Christian McCaffery and Deebo Samuel in the first half. They were also unable to generate much pressure against the 49ers, leading to a small percentage of negative plays and giving the 49ers the opportunity to pick apart the Seahawks passing defense with ease. While the Seahawks were able to get some pressure via their interior pass rush, it was much too little, too late, as the 49ers were able to mitigate these losses with big chunk plays.

**Linebackers**

The Seahawk's weakness at linebacker was exposed today, especially with MLB Jordyn Brooks out with an ACL injury. The Seahawks undersized duo of Tanner Muse and Cody Barton, while playing well in recent weeks, fell apart against the 49ers last Sunday. They missed multiple assignments in coverage and were unable to get off blocks and make a presence in the run game, contributing to the success the 49ers had running the football.

**Secondary Play**

The secondary for the Seahawks was not as bad as the defensive line and linebackers played, but they still did not play to their usual standard. There were several coverage busts that contributed to the 49er's high-powered offensive performance. Several of these plays were on deep-crossers which exposed the Seahawk's defense, illustrating how from the beginning of the game the 49ers had out-schemed the Seahawks on defense.
