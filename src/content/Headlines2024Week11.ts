**Seahawks WRs vs 49ers CBs**
The Seahawks have DK Metcalf, Jaxon Smith-Njigba, and Tyler Lockett back for this game. On the 49ers side, they are missing CB Charvarius Ward while CB Deommodore Lenoir just earned himself a contract extension. Historically, Ward and Lenoir have given Metcalf and the rest of the Seahawks WRs a difficult matchup, albeit now Ward is out. The 49ers, however, have not seen Jaxon Smith-Njigba during his year 2 breakout, especially after he recorded 180 yards against the Los Angeles Rams. This could be a continuation of a breakout for JSN who looks to put up back-to-back 100+ receiving yard games, including his 3rd of the season. With Ward being out, most of the 49ers attention will most likely be centered on limiting Metcalf’s production, which could be the space JSN needs to help Seattle get its first win against the 49ers in their last 6 matchups. If Seattle and Geno Smith have enough time to air the ball out, JSN and Metcalf could be in line for huge games with Lockett getting what is left over. Lenoir may be a player the Seahawks can have a good game against because he gave up the most yards and 2nd highest competition% against the Seahawks in their first matchup this season. Lockett looks like he could build upon his 63-yard performance against the Rams, but likely won’t be a focal point as the Seahawks look to end the 49ers streak of dominance against them.

**Seahawks DL vs 49ers OL**
The Seahawks will have almost all of their defensive starters back this game, besides EDGE Uchenna Nwosu who remains on IR. The 49ers offensive line has Trent Williams, who when healthy is one of the best players in the league, but currently Williams is injured. OG Dominick Puni has also been a standout rookie for the 49ers. The Seahawks played the run extremely well against the Rams but will have a tough matchup against RB Christian McCaffrey and the 49ers offensive line. The Seahawks have also struggled to get ample pressure against opposing QBs in recent weeks, and with the 49ers and Kyle Shanahan being able to scheme any of their playmakers open, this trend could continue against Brock Purdy. A way they could start being able to pass rush more freely could be through stopping the run. The Seahawks started to play Leonard Williams more on the EDGE and changed up their scheme, and with the arrival of Ernest Jones and Tyrice Knight being expected to start after Dodson was released, their success stopping the run against the Rams could be sustained. Knight played earlier in the year and was a quality player at defending the run and had sound tackling. The Seahawks could have a great duo at linebacker, and with a defensive line that held up against the Rams in the run, the 49ers might have trouble running the ball.
