**Offense**

The total score won't show it, but the Seahawks dominated on offense the entire game. They have almost 400 total yards on offense and were the best they have been all season on 3rd down efficiency. Even with this, Geno Smith had his worst game of the season, recording 2 INTs. One INT was clearly his fault, throwing the ball to a double-covered JSN, which ended in his first interception. The other interception seemed to be a miscommunication between him and DK Metcalf as Metcalf stopped running his route to start scrambling to get open for the QB, but Geno threw the ball and, with Metcalf stopping his route, the ball ended up in the hands of a Bengal. Geno needs to be much better if the Seahawks want to have an extended period of success but should have a nice bounce-back game against the Cardinals next week.



The Seahawks had virtually no run game with Kenneth Walker only averaging 3.3 yards per carry and Charbonnet with only 2 carries. They most likely could not get the run game going because Geno Smith's INTs had thrown the team into a pass-heavy game plan to get the lead back. However, with the increased passing statistics, JSN had his best game of the season with 4 catches for 48 yards. Tyler Lockett was 6 receiving yards away from a 100-yard game and DK Metcalf eclipsed 63 yards on 4 receptions. Similarly to Jaxon Smith-Njigba, Jake Bobo also had a breakout game with 2 catches for 43 yards. The Seahawks have a ton of options at WR with two stud rookies starting to emerge within the offense, and it is up to Offensive Coordinator Shane Waldron to use all their talent at wide receiver and tight end and running back efficiently to the max of their ability.

**Defense**

Against the New York Giants, the Seahawks delivered a generational masterpiece that would not be topped. Versus the Bengals who have a high-powered offense with one of the best receiving corps in the NFL, Seattle held Joe Burrow to 185 yards passing with a 2:1 TD-INT ratio. In other words, the Seahawks locked down another offense, one that is widely regarded as a top offense in the league. There was drama created by DK Metcalf with Devon Witherspoon locking down Chase, but Witherspoon did just that, holding Chase to 0 receptions on 2 targets when covered by Witherspoon. Witherspoon has continued to show out, but while he did not top his game against the Giants, he played extremely well against a better team, and the team should be excited for his future as a star in an emerging defense.  

The Seahawks pass rush, unlike the Giants game, did not get 11 sacks but did get 3 sacks, decent enough against an average offensive line with an elite quarterback who knows when to get the ball out. The Seahawks defense held Bengals' ball-carriers to 15 carries for 46 yards, only allowing the Bengals to muster 3.1 yards per carry. Part of the reason the Seahawks are able to lock down the Bengals receiving corps is because they stop the run, forcing opposing offenses to pass the ball to avoid 3 and outs, which the Seahawks have understood and are now able to stop with a near-elite secondary. Tyler Boyd was the Bengals WR3 this game and only had 7 catches for 38 yards. Tee Higgins, the Bengals WR2, only had 2 catches for 20 yards, getting locked down as well. The sky is the limit if the Seahawks can continue this success against other high prolific passing offenses.
