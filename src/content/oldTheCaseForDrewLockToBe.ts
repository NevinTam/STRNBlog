    In Part 1 of this series, we covered why Geno Smith should be the one to start for Seattle in the 2022 Season. If you haven't seen that one you should, however, there is no chronological order you need to view them.

**Pros**

**High Potential**

Lock is only 25 years old and was taken in the 2nd round of the 2019 NFL Draft by the Broncos knowing that he would be a project QB. While the "project" hasn't yielded results yet, Lock has great physical traits that can be utilized by Offensive coordinator Shane Waldron. If Lock can develop into a smarter quarterback that can consistently process the field and make the best reads, there's no reason that he couldn't become a player that the Seahawks start in 2022 and perhaps even beyond.

**Success as a rookie in the NFL**

While Lock has had a rocky NFL career, the best games of his career came during his rookie game when he started 5 games toward the end of the year (2019 season). During this span, he threw for 1020 (204 yds/g) and 7 touchdowns to 4 interceptions and helped his team to a 4--1 record during this time. Lock has noted that the scheme that the Broncos used during this period was similar to the one the Seahawks are using currently, which could maximize his skills as a passer in a game manager role. If Lock finds similar success in Seattle as he did as a rookie, he could be a competent QB for the job and even grow further than that as he continues developing.

**Cons**

**Limited Success in the NFL**

Drew Lock isn't exactly known for his success. Last year he was named the starter but was quickly beat out by veteran Teddy Bridgewater even before the season started. In 2020, his latest season with a large number of starts, he threw for 16 touchdowns and 15 interceptions. So far in his career, he has thrown for 4740 yards, for reference Russell Wilson in his best year threw for 4212 yards, roughly 500 less than Lock's entire career. In his career, he has averaged a 79.3 passer rating and a 25--20 TD-INT ratio. His wins have also not been there with Lock having an abysmal 4--12 record over the last 2 seasons. If Lock can prove himself to be a capable starter that would be excellent, but all signs point to him continuing his "loss" streak with the Seattle Seahawks.

**Inexperience with the Scheme**

The Waldron scheme has been called by many "complicated" or "intricate". The Shane Waldron scheme comes from the Sean McVay offensive system which came from the Shanahan tree. The entire family tree is an extremely complex system that at times has been very hard to learn. While Lock played with a variant of this system in his rookie year, he did that within a limited sample size and since then has gotten worse and worse every year. In the Waldron scheme Lock will have to get the ball out fast to the right player. At times last year, Russell Wilson himself struggled to see the open player many times throughout the season. Wilson struggled while having the whole offseason to learn it as the starter. With Geno Smith on board Lock will have to learn the already complex scheme while not getting complete starter reps. Yet again with Geno already experienced with the scheme, the odds are very much not in Drew Lock's favor.

Drew Lock overall is an interesting candidate for the Seahawk's starting QB job. He's still young (at age 25) and has the physical traits to become a quality QB in the league, but at times with the Broncos has looked unplayable and downright terrible. His potential is probably the highest within the group and has shown that in his rookie year he can play like a game manager-style QB. If the Seahawks see enough within him during training camp, they could take a bet on themselves to continue developing Lock and trot him out as a Week 1 starter.
