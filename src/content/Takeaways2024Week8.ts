**Geno and Offense Sputter**
As is typical with this iteration of the Seattle Seahawks, they constantly seem to work against themselves rather than together. This game featured multiple long Seahawks drives early on in the second quarter only for fatal botched snaps and a failed fourth down conversion, both due to errant plays by center Connor Williams. After these two disastrous drive ending plays, the Seahawks offense never truly re-established momentum. From here on they were always in catchup mode, unable to run the ball and forced to live and die by a strained passing game, especially without star WR DK Metcalf in the lineup. This along with multiple strings of penalties in the last few drives during the 3rd and 4th quarters ended any real chances of a Seahawks comeback, save for a late Zach Charbonnet touchdown.

**Defense Trampled by Bills**
Coming off a triumphant win over the ascending Falcons, the Seahawks defense was primed to prove their dominance in the NFL playing field against an elite opponent. This week also meant the additions of Ernest Jones IV and Tariq Woolen, who came off a multi-week ankle injury. However, the Bills were quickly able to motor down the field, eventually scoring their opening touchdown on Woolen and again on Woolen later in the final seconds second quarter. They were completely lost against the intermediate passing game, allowing Bills rookie Keon Coleman and Khalil Shakir to have career games slowly marching down the field. If the Seahawks wish to compete in the vast NFC Playoff race, they must tighten the ship on defense with a struggling offensive line ahead of their divisional matchup over the Rams next Sunday.
