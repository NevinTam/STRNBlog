**Rushing Attack**

The Rushing attack again played well this week, leading to Kenneth Walkers 3rd game over 100 yards and putting him just over 1000 rushing yards as a rookie. This again was against a Rams defense who, while sustaining several injuries, was able to be a above average team against the run. The Seahawks will need to continue their success in the run game against the 2nd seeded 49ers, who boast the top run defense in the league.

**Geno**

Geno had one of his worst games this week, throwing 2 picks to Rams CB Jalen Ramsey and overall not being as sharp as he usually is. This continues a stretch of bad games near the end of the season for Smith, who will need to be sharp for the playoffs, especially against the 49ers next week, who boast one of the best defenses in the league. While Smith was not great this week, he had a few great plays, including a deep ball touchdown to Tyler Lockett in the 3rd quarter and a huge scramble late in the 4th that set the Seahawks up for a chance to take the lead on the final play of the game.

**Pass Rush**

The Seahawks pass rush played very well in the season's final game, as they put continuous pressure on QB Baker Mayfield, forcing several errant throws. Bruce Irvin led the group with 1.5 sacks, but 4 other Seahawks contributed to the 5 sack performance of the defense. Uchenna Nwosu also had a big game, even though he only recorded 0.5 sacks, he had several pressures that were key to ending drives.

**Secondary Play**

The Seahawks secondary also came in clutch last Sunday, limiting Baker Mayfield to under 150 yards and no touchdowns. Safety Quandre Diggs had one of his best games of the season, recording a clutch interception in overtime, setting up the game-winning field goal by Jason Myers. Outside of the interception, Diggs played extremely well in coverage, allowing 0 completions when playing his traditional deep-safety position. The cornerback group also played well, with Tariq Woolen, Coby Bryant, and Michael Jackson combining to give up 102 yards, helping to limit QB Baker Mayfield in the passing game.
