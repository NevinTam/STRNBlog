**Broncos IOL vs Seahawks IDL**
‎ 
The Seahawks perhaps strongest group on the team is their defensive line. Headlined by Leonard Williams who signed an extension with the team after being traded from the New York Giants in 2023, Williams has had a full offseason with the team under first year head coach Mike Macdonald. Jarran Reed has looked good during training camp after a season where he was near the top of the DT game until fatigue hit mid season. Dre'Mont Jones, despite playing EDGE for the Seahawks most likely this season, may also contribute to the IDL as he faces off against his former team. The star 1st round rookie Byron Murphy will be tasked with sacking the Broncos 1st round rookie Bo Nix. These 4 players will be the Seahawks strongest pass rushers, but Johnathan Hankins will be a nose tackle expected to stop the run. 

On the other side of the ball, the Denver Broncons have Guard Ben Powers who was a good player for the Ravens and is a strong player. They also have Quinn Meinerz at the other guard position who was mocked the Seahawks many times, and has played well and is expected to be a major contributor in 2024. Center Luke Wattenburg has played just a handful of snaps in his 2 year career thus far, but will have a tough matchup against a Seahawks defense that led the NFC in sacks in 2023 and then added Murphy. While Powers and Meinerz are tough tasks, the Seahawks IDL should prove victorious in this matchup with the sheer depth and firepower they have at the position. Expect Bo Nix to be forced out of the pocket with the immense pressure the Seahawks have the potential to bring against the Broncos IOL.

**Seahawks CBs vs Broncos WRs**
‎ 
The Seahawks have one of the best CB rooms in the NFL, so good that they traded away Mike Jackson their CB4 who is now starting on the Panthers just a few weeks being there. The Seahawks have 2023 1st round pick Devon Witherspoon looked much improved off of an already impressive rookie season. 2022 5th round CB Riq Woolen who looks on lockdown and could be one of if not the best cover cornerbacks in the NFL this season. 2021 4th round pick Tre Brown is also in the mix and has had a very good training camp as well.

For the Broncos, they have Courtland Sutton who is their best wide reciever but has not yet lived up to potential. Josh Reynolds from the Lions who is 29 and has never put up 700 yards in his career. Marvin Mims Jr, despite receiving much praise from Broncos fans, is expected to immediately take on a big role for a team that is lacking talent at the position. 

On paper, this Seahawks are clearly favorites in this headline, and it would not be surprising for the game to go in a similar way. With a rookie QB playing in Seattle for the season opener, the receivers may not have the best ability to display their potential this offense. Expect the Seahawks to be dominant against the Broncos WRs with the help of a strong pass rush.

**Broncos CBs vs Seahawks WRs**
‎ 
DK Metcalf and Tyler Lockett and JSN and Bobo are better WRs than PS2, Riley Moss, Ja'Quan McMillian, and Levi Wallace are cornerbacks. The last time PS2 played against the Seahawks, he got the better of DK Metcalf. But DK Metcalf has had the best camp for any offensive player for the Seahawks and looks to get the better of PS2 in this game. Ja'Quan McMillian was top 5 in yards and touchdowns given up in 2023 and is most likely going to have a hard time against JSN who has had a strong camp heading into year 2. While Tyler Lockett is questionable for week 1, he is expected to play and even a Lockett who has not practiced fully in quite a while can most likely beat Moss with his veteran savvy. This looks to be another matchup that the Seahawks should win pretty easily as long as the Seahawks offensive line can hold up. 

If the offensive line holds up and they're able to run the ball, the Seahawks and OC Ryan Grubb should have a plethora of options to put points on the board against a weaker cornerback room in the league with one true star power.
