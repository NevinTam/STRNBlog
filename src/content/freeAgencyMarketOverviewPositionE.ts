For this article, we will discuss 3 different offensive guards the Seahawks could venture to in free agency and sign to start or compete with Phil Haynes at right guard. Both left and right guard positions can be played by most guards interchangeably so the Seahawks could sign a left guard and have them play at right guard and still expect an adequate level of play.

**Isaac Seumalo**

Isaac Seumalo has been one of the elite Eagles' offensive linemen since being drafted in 2016. He is coming off an elite year where he only allowed 1 sack to defenders. Isaac has had many injury concerns has this last year was the only year in his career other than 2019 where he started every game of the season. In 2020 and 2021 combined he only played 12 games but started all of them. Seumalo looks to have beaten the injury bug but can never be too sure with his older age of 29.

**Contract Estimate:**4 years $56 million

**Should the Seahawks Sign:**Seumalo is going to get paid large numbers by a team that needs that sure-fire veteran to protect their franchise QB. Isaac is going to command huge money based on his recent year and Seattle should avoid taking on this contract and look to the draft for cheap options.

**Dalton Risner**

Dalton Risner has been one of the Broncos' better offensive linemen in the last few years. Since being drafted by the Denver Broncos 4 years ago, Risner has been an average lineman that has looked better than he actually is due to the lack of talent around him. In 2021 he seemed to have shown more potential for being an above-average starter, but in 2022 he was looked upon as average once again.

**Contract Estimate:** 2 years $7 million

**Should the Seahawks Sign:** Risner is probably not going to attract much attention in a relatively weak guard market knowing there are many other offensive linemen who fall in the same boat of being average and cheap. Knowing this, the Seahawks should have limited competition to get him and could take a flier on Risner at RG and allow Haynes to compete for the job or have Phil be the Seahawks' 3rd guard.

**Nick Gates**

Nick Gates is a 27-year-old guard who was drafted by the Giants in 2018. Gates is one of those stories where the lineman peaked in their rookie year and never got to that level again. While Gates did not play the whole season in his first year, he was really good as he allowed only 1 sack on under 300 snaps and was graded a 77.0, or an above-average grade. Since then Gates has been average to below average and has come off a horrible leg injury. In 2021, he had a horrible leg injury and played 74 snaps. After having 7 surgeries he was activated near the halfway point of the season and was average for the remainder of the year.

**Contract Estimate:** 1 year $2 million

**Should the Seahawks Sign:** Gates is an intriguing depth option who could beat out Phil Haynes in training camp, but if the Seahawks want a more sure option they should look for the draft for new potential because, with the horrible leg injury of Gates, he may struggle to even maintain his average pedigree. They should avoid Gates and keep Haynes to compete with a rookie from the 2023 NFL Draft.
