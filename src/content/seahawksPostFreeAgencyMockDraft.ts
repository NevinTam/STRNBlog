I won't lie to you all, the Seahawks are at a pretty big crossroads right now.

With the exodus of longtime-tenured HC Pete Caroll, the Seahawks are an almost complete unknown for the first time in over a decade. While yes, they still have John Schnieder spending frugally on free agents (especially after his [comments on the guard position](https://x.com/MikeDugar/status/1768470671422885916?s=20)), we still have no idea on what their draft strategies could be. Will they reach for a running back or a player at a position of need, or will they approach the draft with a BPA (best player available) mindset?

In this installment of 7-round mock drafts we will attempt to address this all-important question through a needs-based lens following free agency. Read below for all our picks:

**TRADE: Seahawks send 1.16, 4.102, 6.179 to Green Bay for 1.25 and 2.41**

The Seahawks are strapped for draft capital as of right now, with no second-round pick and only 2 picks in the top 100 as of right now. A trade-back to the back of the first while netting a second would make perfect sense, especially if the Seahawks don't have a blue-chip prospect left on their board

**Pick 1.25: Oregon C Jackson Powers-Johnson**

The Seahawks have a huge hole right in the interior of the offensive line. While Schnieder has mentioned his disapproval over the overspending of guards, JPJ would be great pickup in the back half of the first round. This would give the Seahawks plenty of flexibility to play him at left guard, next to current C Olu Oluwatimi, or play him at C and look for another guard later in the draft.

JPJ is a monster center, featuring incredible power in both run and pass games. He plays balanced in pass protection and is capable of moving off his initial block and reaching to the second level in run blocking. He has a weakness for speed rushers who will capitalize on JPJ's small lack on agility, and he has a limited starting history, only starting two full seasons for the Ducks.

With a player like JPJ, the Seahawks would have one of the youngest offensive line's in the league - and with that stability. The Seahawks have struggled to maintain continuity at the C position since their Super Bowl run, where they traded Pro Bowl C Max Unger for TE Jimmy Graham. Since then they have employed the following centers:

* Patrick Lewis (2015)

* Justin Britt (2016-19)

* Ethan Pocic (2020-2021)

* Autin Blythe (2022)

* Evan Brown (2023)

Having dominant play and investing resources into a young, talented offensive line would give plenty of firepower for new OC Ryan Grubb and solidify the future in the trenches.

**Pick 2.41: Minnesota S Tyler Nubin**

Reiterating what I said about JPJ, the Seahawks have a long-term issue at safety. While they likely have their starters for the immediate year (with Julian Love and Rayshawn Jenkins), the only saftey they have currently signed past 2025 is 6th-round pick Jerrick Reed. Nubin could offer immediate secondary relief and unique flexcibility to use Nubin as a 3rd-safety, similar to how Julian Love was used last year.

Nubin was a natural free safety for the Golden Gophers, displaying elite traits in ball tracking and range while being a secure tackler in space, with unique utility to play in the box with his natural insticts. However, he is not the most athletic safety, likely leading to serious questions about his game in comparison to other NFL-talent.

Nubin could be utilized as the eventual answer at FS. Free Safety, and safety in general, has long been an issue for the 'Hawks to find continuity at, especially in the draft. Following the exodus of Earl Thomas, the Seahawks paid the price of going cheap at the position with players like Tedric Thompson in 2019, forcing them to implement a trade midway into the season for Quandre Diggs. Nubin would allow them to trust one player to help take away the deep-middle third of the field with great ball skills, like Diggs did, but on a rookie contract. New HC Mike Macdonald's scheme has also been known to attempt to utilize all players to their strengths, which could mean added flexibility with Nubin's rare ability to play in the box.

**Pick 3.81: Michigan LB Junior Colson**  

![](https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/3d88c63b-2b0a-4a2f-b263-f90a4d84c31c_474x351.jpeg)

Colson is one of, if not the most, mocked player to the Seahawks for a few reasons. He fills an immediate hole for the Seahawks at LB and has ties to current HC Mike Macdonald, as Macdonald was the DC for Michigan when Colson was a freshman.

Colson played as the "Mike" linebacker for the Wolverines, and showcased good tackling and block-shedding for an NFL sized LB. However, he can often be caught up when deciding whether or not to commit to the run (ie play-action or delayed hand-offs).

Colson would be a great long-term addition for the Seahawks, as they currently have 0(!) LBs on roster for next season. This would fullfill a future need while giving them flexibility for next season if signings like Tyrell Dodson or Jerome Baker do not work out in the long term. LBs are incredibly important in Mike Macdonalds scheme (as we saw in Baltimore with Patrick Queen and Roquan Smith), so it will be important to reestablish a continuity at LB following the departures of Bobby Wagner and Jordyn Brooks.

**Trade: Seahawks send 4.118 and 7.235 to Dallas for Pick 4.121 and 5.174**

**Pick 4.121: South Dakota State OG Mason McCormick**  

![](https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/fc341ef2-5e0b-46a0-aede-c8db86cf9423_474x266.jpeg)

I think I agree with John Schnieder's guard philosophy on this one.

While the Seahawks have 2 sizable holes on offense, I think that Anthony Bradford showed good promise as a rookie, especially in the run-blocking department. Picking up McCormick in a deep offensive-line draft would provide immediate competition for the LG position opposite Bradford. There is also an [understanding](https://x.com/CorbinSmithNFL/status/1772628802427814233?s=20) that the Seahawks could pick up [another guard in free agency](https://x.com/BradyHenderson/status/1772628744907243639?s=20).

McCormick would be a player that could provide immediate starter-upside on the left side with his impressive athletic traits that he showcased over his 2 years starting. He generates lots of force as a run blocker and is great at picking up stunts/blitzes, but at times has shown the ability to get beat with more experienced DTs.

Like what I said earlier with Center, the guard position has been a rotating carousel of mid-level talent since that super-bowl run. There have only been 4 players that have entered the season starting at guard for the Seahawks for 2 or more seasons since their Super Bowl run:

* JR Sweezy (2015 and 2018)

* DJ Fluker (2018-2019)

* Damien Lewis (2020-2023)

* Gabe Jackson (2021-2022)

Drafting a guard here would be critical for maintaing continuity, especially with a brand-new offensive coaching staff headlined by OL Coach Steve Huff, who has developed a handful NFL linemen at his previous stint in UW, such as Troy Fatanu, Kaleb McGary, Roger Rosengarten, Luke Watternberg, and Nick Harris.

**Pick 5.174: Iowa TE Erick Ali**  

![](https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/dd51338b-f8dc-436b-a9a0-b5c369e45854_1200x703.jpeg)

TE here would be the next logical pick in a deep tight-end draft and the Seahawks seemingly needing a TE3 that provides more recieving upside than Pharoh Brown ([who Schnieder called a top 2-3 blocking TE in the league](https://x.com/johnpboyle/status/1768408568330641777?s=20)). Erick Ali fills this role as a great YAC option that can win deep against defenses. He too provides good blocking in the run-game, but struggles as a pass-protector. He at times has concentration drops and is not the fastest.

Ali would give the Seahawks much needed depth after resigning Noah Fant and giving Brown a 1-year deal. Ali could become TE2 in snaps part-way into the season in 2-3 TE sets that the Seahawks were successful in last year.

**Pick 6.192:** **Iowa DT Logan Lee**  

![](https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/1429417d-5782-484f-aa3f-30af9b691c62_474x315.jpeg)


The Seahawks double up with Iowa players at 6.192.

The Seahawks could look to beef up the youth of their defensive line after resigning Leonard Williams in free agency. The Seahawks struggled to find IDL to give snaps to at the end of the season due to injuries and overall attrition. Drafting a player like Lee would give the Seahawks much-needed depth and flexibility for players like Dre'Mont Jones to move the outside and play EDGE on certain snaps.

Lee provides much-needed help to the 3-tech position, which allows him to showcase his skillset in rushing the passer. He has shown to be somewhat of a liability when setting the edge in run defense but is good at tracking and pursuing the ball carrier.

Lee could step in as an immediate backup competing with guys like Mike Morris, Cameron Young, and Myles Adams for rotational snaps. Following this year though, the Seahawks will have holes in the DL, that coming from a possible Dre'Mont Jones cut or Jarran Reed leaving in free agency. This provides the perfect opportunity for a player like Lee to grow into a bigger role.
