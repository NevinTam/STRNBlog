**QB Geno Smith vs. Browns Secondary**

Geno Smith is coming off one of his lesser 2-game stretches. While he was good against the Cardinals, the frequent redzone issues were present yet again after he threw an interception there, targeting WR Jake Bobo. Geno had several great throws last Sunday, however, especially one in an extremely tight window to TE Noah Fant on that same drive. Geno will have to secure the football more against a tough Browns secondary that was looking like the best unit in the league for most of the season. Last week, they were able to get beat on several explosives that hurt their overall effectiveness. CBs Greg Newsome II and Denzel Ward have played lockdown and lived up to their first round draft status's. This high profile secondary will likely lead Geno to play a bit more of a conservative game against the Browns

**T Charles Cross and Stone Forsythe/Jake Curhan/Jason Peters vs. EDGE Myles Garrett**

The Seahawks have a number of players they could play at RT this week with Abraham Lucas still on IR. They could play Stone Forsythe there like they did last week against the Cardinals. However, RT is not Forsythe's natural position, which may lead to some issues when playing rushers that win with speed. Jake Curhan naturally plays RT, but he himself might be in a rough state after coming off injury and having to play against Myles Garrett, one of, if not the best, pass rusher in the league. Curhan also notably struggles with pass protection as compared to his run blocking, leading to questions if they should start him across such a dynamic pass rusher in Garrett. The Seahawks could also start Jason Peters, recently signed out of free agency. Peters is active for the game, and has played against Garett before. He allowed 4.5 sacks to Garrett against the Bears in 2021, which may lead to bad news for the Seahawks pass protection overall. Look for the Seahawks to utilize lots of chips and TE help to give Smith as much time as possible.

**CBs Tariq Woolen and Devon Witherspoon vs. WR Amari Cooper**

Devon Witherspoon has been on a tear this season, looking to gain DROY honors while playing lights out football in pass coverage and run defense. In his first season, he's already been an incredible tone-setter with his physicality, only matched with S Jamal Adams's. Woolen has seen a bit of a sophomore slump, as he has given up a few touchdowns and critical penalties have been called on him. In coverage, however, he is still playing very well, as he has allowed under 200 yards through 6 games. Look for them to attempt to contain WR Amari Cooper, one of the league's premier veteran WRs and likely the Brown's best offensive weapon on Sunday. The Seahawks defense will have to limit explosives to Cooper as this game will likely have to shape up into a defensive slugfest as both defenses are playing elite as of late.

**EDGEs Boye Mafe and Darrell Taylor vs. Jedrick Willis Jr. and Dawand Jones**

The Seahawks will be without one of their best pass rushers in OLB Uchenna Nwosu, who suffered a season-ending pectoral injury against the Cardinals last week. The Seahawks will have to generate pressure on the Browns offensive line, which is one of their strengths. Darrell Taylor recently had 1.5 sacks against the Cardinals as well, which will be critical. The recent signing of Frank Clark will also help the Seahawks pass rush to mitigate the loss of Nwosu. Clark may not be able to do much in his first game, but if he can get a few pressures it will help greatly. If the Seahawks can put more pressure on PJ Walker, they will be able to win the turnover battle and control the flow of the game.
