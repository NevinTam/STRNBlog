    This "new look" Seattle offensive line has 3 new starters across the entire board. Replace Gabe Jackson with Phil Haynes; the average age across the starting offensive line is 25. While this new o-line may be extremely inexperienced there is a solid mix of high-potential players and proven veterans. Take a look to see an in-depth look at each offensive lineman and what they provide for the 2022--2023 season.

**Offensive Line Starters:**

**LT: Charles Cross**

The 9th pick out of the 2022 NFL Draft, Charles Cross is an elite athlete with exceptional pass-blocking prowess. While he was in an Air-Raid offense of Mike Leach's system during college, he was rarely asked to run block, leaving most concerned about his abilities. Arguably the most refined pass rusher in the draft, Cross has already cemented himself as the starter from the first snap of the Seahawks Offseason. While there were concerns about his ability to run block, there have been no reports reporting any immense struggle leading to believe during college he could've run block, but was never asked for it.

**Status:**Starter Lock

**LG: Damien Lewis**

Entering his third year, Damien Lewis is primed for a bounce-back season. After making the All-Rookie team in 2020 as a right guard and an excellent run blocker, Lewis had a bit of a sophomore slump after being moved to left guard. With a year of left-guard experience under his belt, we will see how Lewis will improve in this starting guard spot, or maybe if he will be moved back to his original spot at right guard.

**Status:**Starter Lock

**C: Austin Blythe**

Austin Blythe was the Seahawks' main free agent signing this offseason and filled a big hole at center after Ethan Pocic left in free agency. Blythe was a player that was rumored to come to Seattle the last offseason, following a strong campaign with the Rams under now Seahawks coaches Shane Waldron and Andy Dickerson. He then signed with the Chiefs and suffered injuries and had less playing time after the emergence of All-Pro rookie center Creed Humphrey. Now reunited with Shane Waldron and Andy Dickerson, Blythe hopes to again see the level of play he had under the Rams in a similar Seahawks scheme.

**Status:**Starter Lock

**RG: Gabe Jackson**

Gabe Jackson was acquired in a trade with the Raiders last offseason and reworked his contract to be a 3-year contract (now 2 years left). His increasing age has led to rumors of trade talks in order to increase the playtime of other promising guards on the roster, such as Phil Haynes and Damien Lewis (moving him back to RG). Therefore, benching Gabe Jackson for younger and higher potential guards isn't out of the realm of possibility.

**Status:**Likely Starter

**RT: Abraham Lucas**

While the rookie Abraham Lucas' spot as the Seahawks' starting right tackle is all but confirmed, he looks like a seasoned veteran with ferocious blocks in both the run and pass game. Like Cross coming from an "Air-Raid" offense, Lucas was expected to be a steady development in the run game, however through 3 preseason games that have clearly been not the case. Lucas has put multiple "pancakes" in each game denying any idea that the former Washington tackle would get bullied in the run game. Abe has also been a phenomenal pass protector, only allowing 1 pressure in the first two preseason games. Due to Lucas' pleasant surprise in the run game and less surprisingly expertise in the passing game, Lucas easily beat out both Curhan and Forsythe cementing himself as the Week 1 Starter.

**Status:**Likely Starter

**Backups:**

**LG: Phil Haynes**

As a fourth-round pick in the 2019 draft, Haynes has rarely heard his name called in the last 3 years. Whenever anyone had thought of Haynes their first image was an injured player who had high potential but was never healthy for the Seahawks. However, all that changed last year when Haynes was able to play a few games at the stretch of last year. During his limited 2021 experience, Haynes proved proficient enough in pass-blocking but exceptional in run-blocking with the rest of the lineman, paving gaping holes for Rashaad Penny's elite performances. As said by Pete Carroll earlier in the offseason, the Seahawks have 3 capable starting guards on the roster. Haynes is able to plug in for any of the starters in front of him, whether it be due to injury or they simply got beat, and have no decrease in play in the overall offensive line.

**Status:** Depth/Starter

**RT: Jake Curhan**

An undrafted rookie with no intention of playing, Curhan was thrust into the starting role due to continuous injuries to 2021 starter Brandon Shell and played admirably. Able to be an absolute mauler in the run game Curhan continuously bodied helpless defensive linemen sending them yards back or straight to the ground. The hope was that with a full offseason Curhan would be able to become refined in the passing game and become a starter, however, drafting a player who was already refined enough in both aspects had sent Curhan to the bench. Still being young, Curhan should be able to learn to control his feet and hand placement but remains a viable backup who can be plugged in at tackle and guard whenever needed. If Curhan keeps developing his pass blocking he could easily compete for a starting job in the near future.

**Status:** Depth/Starter

**LT: Stone Forsythe**

Slated to be LT2 behind rookie Charles Cross, Forsythe was drafted only one year ago in the 6th round as part of the Seahawks' league-low 3-player draft class. Forsythe's strength is in the passing game, where he was best at Florida in a heavy passing game. He was able to demonstrate this in the handful of snaps he was given his rookie season, going against Nick Bosa for a handful of pass-rushing snaps and holding his own against the pro bowl defensive end. Look for Forsythe to again play a backup role as he continues to progress and potentially be able to backup at RT if Abraham Lucas and Jake Curhan both go down with an injury.

**Status:**Depth

**C: Kyle Fuller**

As someone who has played center, tackle, and guard, Fuller remains on the team primarily for his depth. Starting for the Seahawks for a limited time Fuller immensely struggled and was happily benched in exchange for a healthy Ethan Pocic. Fuller hasn't been able to win a starting job even with being on the Seahawks team for 3 full seasons. The front office also has shown very little faith in Fuller as they immediately went for Austin Blythe during the opening hours of free agency. Being a serviceable backup, Fuller will be able to be plugged in during any small injuries that occur for the starters, but may not play well in exchange for longer breaks due to his continuous struggles from the 2021 NFL Season.
