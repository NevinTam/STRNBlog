**Geno Smith**

Geno Smith came into this game somewhat cold on offense, not leading any scoring drives until the second half and having a mostly lackluster performance against the Buccaneers defense. Following a Tariq Woolen interception, Geno was able to lead a drive into the opposing red-zone, but had an egregious fumble that took away a key scoring opportunity and led to the buccaneers extending their lead to 18. He was able to lead 2 touchdown drives in the 4th that included some sensational throws, but at that time it was "too little, too late", as the defense was not able to give the offense one last opportunity to score. Overall, Geno played decently, but the Seahawks will need him to step up more early on when the run game gets stymied.

**Kenneth Walker and the Offensive Line**

Kenneth Walker had one of his worst starter games last week, unable to fully utilize the blocks in front of him to gain yardage in the rushing game. While the offensive line did not play amazingly in the run game, they still gave Walker these opportunities against the Tampa Bay defensive line. Walker still had a productive day in the receiving game, though, recording 6 receptions (2nd on the team) for 55 yards, most of which came on the final 2 touchdown drives for the Seahawks. The offensive line, while not having a great day in the ground game, played well in pass protection, especially in the second half.

**Tight End Usage**

Tight ends were used in the Seahawks offense effectively in past Seahawks games, gaining lots of yardage on chunk completions to pick up first downs. In this game, however, tight ends were seldom used last Sunday, which led to an inconsistent first half offense. When the offense started to pick up in the 2nd half, mainly the 4th quarter, tight ends were used as normal, leading to several first down conversions.

**D line play**

Much of the Seahawks defensive issues on Sunday stemmed from the defensive line, as they were unable to stop the buccaneers rushing attack (which was one of if not the worst in the league). This led the Buccaneers to keep the score low while dominating the time of possession, leading them to rush for over 150 yards and ultimately close out the game when the defense could not stop the rushing attack to give the offense one more opportunity to score. They also were unable to put much pressure on Brady, which allowed him to stay in the pocket and pick apart the defense. On several throws it seemed like Brady had ages to throw, allowing him to find a busted coverage when it occurred. Part of the Seahawks pass-rush troubles also come from the fact that Brady has one of the fastest release times in the league, making it difficult to put pressure on him before the ball is thrown. The Seahawks will need more from their defensive line, specifically the interior, to help stop the run and force pressure on the quarterback.

**Game Planning**

It overall seemed that the Seahawks were unprepared for the Buccaneers game plan last week. They underestimated their devotion to the run game and were not able to put pressure on Tom Brady. This was apparent even before the game started, when the Seahawks played the smaller Myles Adams instead of Bryan Mone, who excels more at the run than pass. The Seahawks also were unprepared on offense, starting off slow on offense when usually the Seahawks are one of the best teams on offense in the first quarter.

**Coby Bryant**

This was arguably Coby Bryant's worst game as a pro in his rookie season. He gave up several completions in the slot to Mike Evans and Chris Godwin as he was picked on by Tom Brady. He was a liability in this game and contributed to allowing the Buccaneers to maintain an offensive consistency on passing downs that led to 3 long touchdown drives that took much time off the clock. While Coby Bryant did not play well, it can be expected for him to improve in coverage as he was still in close coverage on many of the completions he allowed, but he was just not able to come close enough to make a play on the ball.
