    Well, it's that time of year again. The 2022 NFL Draft is a month behind us, but there are plenty of people already looking forward to the 2023 NFL Draft in Kansas City. If there's anything that should stick out to you in some of these early mock drafts, it's big name quarterbacks that usually occupy spots in the top 5 picks. With the 2022 QB class being bad by most standards, analysts are hyping up the 2023 class to be filled with much better talent than its predecessor.

After watching a handful of quarterbacks I've come up with my early top 5 going into the 2022--23 season. You probably know the names CJ Stroud and Bryce Young off the top of your head if you watched any CFB this season, and I'll be sure to give my take on who I think has the edge between the two while also diving into the other guys you may not know too well. Here we go!

1. CJ Stroud --- Ohio State

I have come to believe that if you ask different people to pick between Stroud and Young the answers split pretty evenly. Over the course of the season, I think one of them will eventually separate himself from the other, but until then I'll give the edge to the buckeye QB.

Stroud has the prototypical frame for an NFL quarterback, with size, a strong arm, and good mobility, all things that teams look for in a franchise quarterback. During his first season as a starter, he has shown himself to be a solid processor who can throw with good anticipation. It'll be interesting to see how he does this year after losing 2 of his top receivers to the NFL, but look for Stroud to lead the Buckeyes to the CFP and possibly add a Heisman to his name.

2. Bryce Young --- Alabama

Young shows some of the same promising traits as Stroud, but his frame is a little smaller. He has the advantage over Stroud because of his slightly better mobility and ability to make defenders miss in the open field. What puts him, Young, at the number two spot is his tendency to play hero ball at times. Instead of making the smart play, he'll go for the big play which sometimes ends up hurting the team. Young will also have to get better at staying poised under pressure and not forcing throws. However, when I'm remaking these rankings postseason I'm fully prepared for Young to take the #1 spot from Stroud.

3. Will Levis --- Kentucky

While it would be a shock to many who didn't pay attention to preseason mock drafts, Will Levis could end up being the number one QB next spring. A quick google search will show you that Will Levis is 6'3 232 pounds, pretty big for QB standards. Besides his bigger stature, he brings better arm talent to the table compared to Stroud and Young. On film the flashes are so good one could easily see him going number one. But readiness for an NFL offense is still in question. Levis needs to take a big jump in his ability to read the field this season to have a shot at being QB1.

4. Tyler Van Dyke --- Miami

While the first three quarterbacks on this list have relatively good mobility, Tyler Van Dyke is more limited in that regard and will do most of his damage from the pocket. Van Dyke took over for D'eriq King as the Hurricane's starting quarterback last year and made a good overall impression. He has the arm talent to make all the throws required of an NFL QB and then some. This year he should look to put together a consistent season and improve on his accuracy and anticipation. However for me, the biggest thing he needs to work on before I can consider him a top ten pick is shortening his throwing motion so that his throws can get out quicker and reach the receiver on time.

5. Grayson McCall --- Coastal Carolina

Now you'll see many big name football news sites list Anthony Richardson (or even Tanner McKee if you're PFF) here as the 5th ranked QB, the top 4 being in my opinion a tier above the rest of the pack. But when I was going through the film of quarterbacks eligible for next year's draft the only guy who really stood out was Coastal Carolina's, Grayson McCall. McCall doesn't have near the level of arm talent as the aforementioned names, but the mental traits are there to where you could possibly trust him starting day one. He ran the Coastal offense efficiently, making his reads and throwing with good touch and anticipation. His lack of arm talent and the appearance of any late QB risers will end up determining whether he can go round 1 or not.
