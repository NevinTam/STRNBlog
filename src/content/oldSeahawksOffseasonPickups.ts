    The Seattle Seahawks went and got numerous "bargain bin" free agents this offseason while giving the most APY (Average Per Year) salary to any outsider free agent during General Manager John Schnieder's tenure. They also acquired several players in a blockbuster trade with the Denver Broncos. We will go over each player's production and whether their contract was worth the price they are paid.

**Seahawks Returning Free Agents**

**RB Rashaad Penny**

**2021 Stats**: 119 Attempts --- 749 Yards --- 6.3 Average --- 6 Touchdowns

**Contract:**1 year $5.75 million, $5.07 million guaranteed

Rashaad Penny resigned with the Seahawks on a short-term deal, which according to Ian Rapoport of NFL Network, was less than what other teams were offering. This is a strong deal for a running back who was arguably the best running back in the NFL the last 6 weeks of the 2021 season, totaling over 670 yards during that span. A good signing for a team with a foggy vision at quarterback.

**CB Sidney Jones IV**

**2021 Stats:** 61% Completion Rate --- 419 Yards --- 2 Touchdowns --- 84.3 Rating

**Contract:**1 year $3.6 million, $1.3 million guaranteed

Sidney Jones IV came back on a potential starter/depth contract as 1 year for 3.6 million. Sidney Jones IV struggled early in his career but once he came to Seattle he proved his second-round draft pick to be worthy. In the middle of the season, once he became used to the defense he started performing extremely well only allowing 124 yards in his final 6 games. A strong signing for him to lock down an outside corner role.

**FS Quandre Diggs**

**2021 Stats:** 5 Interceptions --- 65.9% Completion Rate --- 406 Yards --- 63.4 Rating

**Contract:**3 years $40 million, $26.98 million guaranteed

Quandre Diggs has continued to be a turnover machine with 10 Interceptions combined in the last two seasons. He deserves his 3-year, 40 million contract along with his ability to make plays. Coming off a gruesome leg injury production may not be the same but is still expected to be high due to his fast recovery. Locking up the safety position with Quandre Diggs furthermore makes this a good signing.

**TE Will Dissly**

**2021 Stats:** 26 targets ---21 receptions --- 231 yards --- 1 touchdown

**Contract:**3 years $24 million, $15.98 million guaranteed

Will Dissly throughout his Seahawks career has not always lived up to his potential. He had great starts to the season in 2018 and 2019 but got season-ending injuries and has struggled to find that same level of pre-injury production since. However, Dissly is a good blocking TE, and from the size of the contract, it seems that he will be getting more opportunities when the season comes. However, based on Dissly's initial production this seems to be an overpay.

**DT Al Woods**

**2021 Stats:**50 tackles --- 4 tackles for loss --- 1.5 sacks --- 5 QB hits

**Contract:**2 years $9 million, $4.73 million guaranteed

Al Woods is one of those NFL "journeyman" players, who has bounced around many teams throughout his 11-year career in the NFL. After signing with the Seahawks to a 1-year deal, the 35-year-old didn't miss a beat, becoming a monster on the interior of the line and helping lead one of the best run defenses in the league. Despite playing nose tackle often, he was able to generate pressure at times in key moments and was a key leader on defense. A great signing overall.

**QB Geno Smith**

**2021 Stats:**3 starts --- 5 touchdowns --- 1 interception --- 103.0 Passer Rating

**Contract:**1 year $4 million, incentives up to $7 million

Geno Smith has been a mere backup behind the glorious and "unlimited" Russell Wilson for most of his tenure with the Seattle Seahawks. However, last season with Wilson getting injured Geno Smith was thrust into the starting role for the first time since 2017 and threw for an impressive 701 yards and 5 touchdowns to one single interception. Geno will now get a chance to compete with newly acquired quarterback Drew Lock for the starting job.

**Outside Free Agents**

Free Agents the Seahawks acquired that were not on Seattle's team this past season.

**OLB Uchenna Nwosu**

**2021 Stats:**40 tackles --- 5 sacks --- 1 interception

**Contract:**2 years $19.055 million, $10.535 million guaranteed

Uchenna Nwosu, given a chance in 2021, posted career highs in sacks justifying the high upside on his contract. With the switch to a 3--4 style defense Nwosu can be an effective 3--4 OLB thriving in a pass-rush role. As a second-round pick from the 2018 NFL Draft, Uchenna Nwosu could succeed as a full-time starter, without Joey Bosa taking his snaps. A large offer for a player that fits a need with a huge upside.

**CB Artie Burns**

**2021 Stats:**23 tackles --- 0 interceptions ---65.4% completion --- 115.1 Passer Rating

**Contract:**1 years $2.035 million, $1.000 million guaranteed

After hiring Sean Desai it was only inevitable a Chicago Bears player would take pursuit with him. Artie Burns, a former first-round pick for the Pittsburgh Steelers, struggled early in his career but played valiantly in his last season with Chicago. Pete Carroll makes magic out of "nobody" corners, evidenced most recently with DJ Reed and Sidney Jones IV, and this seems to be another case of Pete Carroll's DB Coach expertise shining through. A near veteran minimum contract towards a player that could potentially start.

**C Austin Blythe**

**2021 Stats:**0 starts --- 4 games played

**Contract:**1 year $4 million, $2.5 million guaranteed

Austin Blythe may trigger a memory for some fans in the 2021 off-season. The Seahawks were rumored to obtain him last offseason to compete with Ethan Pocic but Blythe signed with the Kansas City Chiefs. A potentially bad signing by the Chiefs as Blythe remained a backup for the entire year behind PFF All-Pro Creed Humphrey. While Blythe has not played for an entire year this could also mean he is full of energy player who can lock down the center position for the Seattle Seahawks. Perhaps, a slight overpay but everything with margins for a perfect schematic-fit center.

**ILB Joel Iyiegbuniwe**

**2021 Stats:**4 tackles

**Contract:**1 year $1.18 million, $152 thousand guaranteed

Joel Iyiegbuniwe, another former Chicago Bear, has been a special teams ace for the majority of his career. The Seahawks already have a top-tier special team group thus it ponders the question of whether will Joel only be on special teams or if can he compete for a job with Cody Barton and Jordyn Brooks. With little money guaranteed Joel Iyiegbuniwe could be a "diamond in the rough" for the Seahawks.

**CB Justin Coleman**

**2021 Stats:**63.2% Completion Rate --- 279 Yards --- 0 Touchdowns --- 63.4 Rating

**Contract:**1 year $1.12 million, $152 thousand guaranteed

Justin Coleman, a former Seattle corner who arguably was the best slot corner in the entire John Schneider tenure, is returning for a 1-year contract. After playing well for the Dolphins, Seattle felt the need to bring stability back to their corner room signing Coleman for a near veteran minimum contract. This strongly helps out a corner room without a clear vision at slot with oft-injured Marquise Blair and Ugo Amadi, who after a strong campaign in 2020 was beaten many times in coverage in 2021. A nice low-risk, high-reward signing for a good player.

**DT Quinton Jefferson**

**2021 Stats:**47 tackles --- 5 tackles for loss --- 4.5 sacks --- 16 QB hits

**Contract:**2 years $9.5 million, $5.175 million guaranteed

Quinton Jefferson, another familiar player who was drafted by the Seahawks in 2016, is returning to the Seattle Seahawks to be a strong presence on the defensive line in the newly switched 3--4 scheme. Jefferson, with the Raiders, posted career highs in sacks with 4.5 and combined tackles with 47. Jefferson also is an ideal frame for a 3--4 defensive end and is in the midst of his prime making him a solid signing. Jefferson sharing the room with Poona and Harris makes the 3--4 DE room balanced throughout. A cheap signing for an effective player that is coming off career-highs in a few major categories to help create stability for the defensive line.

**Traded Players**

In a massive blockbuster that sent Russell Wilson to the Denver Broncos, the Seahawks received 3 players.

**DT Shelby Harris**

**2021 Stats:**49 tackles --- 7 tackles for loss --- 6.0 sacks --- 11 QB hits

**Contract:**3 years $27 million, $15.00 million guaranteed (1 year remaining)

Shelby Harris was previously linked to Seattle the previous times he was a free agent, and according to Pete Caroll, will play 3-technique in the Seahawk's new 3--4 hybrid defense. Harris is a player that the Seahawks could desperately use, as he provides an outlet for consistent interior pressure that the Seahawks have not had in quite some time. A valuable player that could help teach the young guys in the locker room.

**QB Drew Lock**

**2021 Stats:**3 starts --- 2 touchdowns --- 2 interceptions --- 80.4 Passer Rating

**Contract:**4 years $7.010 million, $3.932 million guaranteed (1 year remaining)

Drew Lock is a quarterback that John Schnieder has said previously had intrigued him during the draft process. Seattle believes that they can mold him into the QB that can effectively manage the offense after a subpar career so far within the Denver offense. An interesting player with some upside, Lock will compete with Geno Smith and possibly a rookie for the starting job.

**TE Noah Fant**

**2021 Stats:**90 targets --- 68 receptions ---670 yards --- 4 touchdowns

**Contract:**4 years $12.590 million, $9.883 million guaranteed, a 5th-year option worth 6.85 million fully guaranteed (2 years left including 5th-year option)



Only at age 24, Noah Fant is a freakishly athletic TE that can be utilized as the dominant pass-catching TE that Seattle has not seen since Jimmy Graham. It will be interesting to see how offensive coordinator Shane Waldron will scheme Fant into Seattle's WC-style offense. He already has a strong connection with QB Drew Lock and with 2 years left on his contract, could be a key building block in Seattle's plan for contention within the next few years.

While the Seahawks have gone out and gotten many players, through free agency and trades, they definitely have positions that remain to be fully addressed. With the 2022 NFL Draft within a few long weeks, fanbases from around the country will hope their team drafts the best players available. The Seahawks are no exception in needing to draft immense talent with their scheduled 8 draft picks due to their decision to not carefully address each position of need in free agency.
