The Seahawks (1-2) matchup with a heavily injured Lions (1-2) team this Sunday in Detroit at 10 AM PST. The Lions Offense has been at the top of the league, being a top 3 offense scoring wise going and will be going against a defense that is yielding yardage at a below average level. However, several key playmakers are out with injury this week including DJ Chark, Amon-Ra St Brown, and RB Deandre Swift. Here are 5 matchups that will be key this game.

1. **Seahawks WRs DK Metcalf + Tyler Lockett vs Lions CBs Jeff Okudah + Amani Oruwariye**

   Okudah is coming off a great 3 games where he was able to shut down great receivers like Devontae Smith, Terry McLaurin, and even last year's 2nd team All-Pro Justin Jefferson. Okudah plays with a very physical style, aggresively pressing the reciever to disrupt their route. Metcalf similarly plays with an aggressive play style, making this a fun matchup to watch. Lockett has been off to a great start to the season, already leading the team in yards and receptions. Oruwariye hasn't been as good as his counterpart, as he's given up 135 yards and close to a 75% completion percentage. Even if Metcalf gets shut down by Okudah, look for Lockett to breakout, as there has been a trend that the player opposite to the WR Okudah is primarily playing against has a big day. Some examples of this include AJ Brown, Adam Thielen, and Curtis Samuel.

2. **Seahawks RBs Rashaad Penny + Kenneth Walker III vs Lions Front 7**

   The Seahawks rushing attack has been at the bottom of the league for the past 3 weeks despite emphasis on the run was present all throughout the offseason. Fortunately, the Lions run defense also is one of the worst against the run, showing an example of "movable object vs stoppable force". One of the two sides must win this matchup, and the Seahawks could desperately use their rushing attack to sustain their offense, who has at times fell off during the 2nd half.

3. **Seahawks Front 7 vs Lions O-line + Lions RB Jamaal Williams**

   In a more unfortunate matchup for the Seahawks, the Seahawks Front 7 has been at the bottom of the league in defending the run, and the Lions have been a top 3 rushing offense. However, since Deandre Swift suffered from injury, they will have to turn to Jamaal Williams, who hasn't been as productive as Swift, who is close to averaging over 8.5 YPC. Williams is only averaging 3.9 YPC behind the same offensive line, giving a chance that the Seahawks could stop the Lions after this drop-off in their rushing attack.

4. **Seahawks OLBs Uchenna Nwosu + Darryl Johnson/Boye Mafe/Darell Taylor vs Lions OTs Taylor Decker + Penei Sewell**

   It's no secret that the Seahawks need to increase their pass rush, ranking below-average in pressure and sack-rates. Detroit's offensive line pass-blocking wise has been near the middle of the pack, with a 57% ESPN Pass Block win-rate, ranking 19th. The Seahawks will have to turn up the pressure this game in order to force Goff into making mistakes and overall slowing down the Lions offense.

5. **Seahawks OTs Charles Cross + Abraham Lucas vs Lions DEs Aidan Hutchinson + Charles Harris**

   The Seahawks set of rookie offensive tackles have been nothing short of great for the Seahawks, as both have performed well in pass-blocking for the most part. Today they're going against the No. 2 Overall pick in the draft, Aidan Hutchinson, who already has 3 sacks (all in one game). On the other side, Charles Harris, who led the Lions in sacks last season with 7.5, is playing the edge. Look for the battle along the tackles to be critical to keeping Geno upright, as Geno often does not see pressure from his tackles fast enough to move away (Even though this is something that has been mentioned as a thing to work on during press conferences). Something that should help the young tackle duo is the fact that Geno gets the ball out quick, leading to an offense consisted on short passes.
