**Seahawks DL vs Rams OL**
The Seahawks got beat up in the run game badly last week. James Cook rushed for over 100 yards and had 2 rushing TDs on the day. They now face against Kyren Williams who has been a touchdown monster in his career, currently on an impressive TD streak this season. Mike Macdonald has gone out and said that they’ll focus more on things that they do better and likely simplify what they do, but will it be enough? Macdonald has been transparent with what he has said and done so far this season, so there is a good chance that the Seahawks can actually stop the run and be more physical across the defensive line this season. If so, they’ll be able to get the Rams into more obvious passing situations and focus on the pass rush, allowing them to continue thriving in an area that they worked well in earlier this season. The Rams have been incredibly injured so far this season, and their offensive line is no exception. Meanwhile, the Seahawks look to have almost everyone back on their defensive line for this game, so this could be a game with a lot of pressure from the Seahawks defensive line. However, that hinges on if they can successfully stop the run. Matthew Stafford has veteran savvy, and while they might get often pressure, they might not be able to affect him too much with that pressure or even get sacks on him. The Seahawks have had a lack of physicality on both sides of the ball throughout this season and hope that Murphy and Williams, who individually did not have great games against the Bills, bounce back as the Seahawks attempt to not go 0-2 in the division. Ernest Jones could be a big piece for the Seahawks as he faces off against his former team and tries to help the Seahawks stop the run.

**Seahawks OL vs Rams DL**
The Seahawks offensive line has been one of the worst in the league so far. Charles Cross started off the season elite, but has regressed to average to above-average. Laken Tomlinson has slowly been improving this season it feels, but is still a bottom guard in the NFL. Connor Williams started off the season badly, played well for a few weeks, then appears to have regressed. Anthony Bradford has had a clean month of playing football without penalties and appears to have won the right guard competition over Christian Haynes. Lastly, Mike Jerrell has started two games for the Seahawks as their fourth-string right tackle and looks to be the backup to the team’s second-string right tackle George Fant who is expected to make his return from IR. Abe Lucas will most likely be back after the bye week where the Seahawks face off against the 49ers. In other words, the Seahawks have one of the worst offensive lines in the league and even against a Rams team that lost Aaron Donald, they will probably struggle and allow constant pressure on Geno Smith. 

Kobie Turner has been a nice player for the Rams so far, along with rookies like Jared Verse and Braden Fiske. If the Seahawks can create lanes for Walker to run through, this could be a huge game for the Seahawks offense that will still be without DK Metcalf this week. If not, it may be hard for anything to happen, knowing how JSN and Lockett did not garner much against the Bills with the first absence of Metcalf. AJ Barner put up a career high in yards against the Bills, and looks to be tight end one with Noah Fant out.
