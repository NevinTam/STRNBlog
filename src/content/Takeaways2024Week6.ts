The Seahawks fall to 3-3 after losing 3 straight, including last Thursday night against the 49ers. Read below for our takeaways from the game!

**Offense and Geno Flatline, Again**

Much like last week against the 49ers, the Seahawks did not come to play on offense tonight. Geno Smith uncharacteristically had a few off throws, leading to 2 interceptions and multiple missed throws that hurt scoring drives. The Seahawks also had a multitude of offensive penalties that shot them in the foot, including an illegal formation penalty that wiped out a long touchdown by DK Metcalf. The Seahawks struggled to get the ground game going against the 49ers, who have struggled massively against the run, especially in their loss to the Cardinals last week. If the Seahawks continue to shoot themselves in the foot week-in and week-out, it’ll be extremely difficult for them to move forward in a crowded NFC wildcard race.

**Defense Gashed on Primetime**
Similarly to the Giants game Sunday, the Seahawks defense looked shallow in their run fits and overall intermediate pass coverage, allowing the Niners to move the ball methodically behind a strong rushing attack. Their run defense allowed over 200 yards on almost 7 yard per carry efficiency. Their poor run defense also opened up the passing game, allowing George Kittle to have multiple touchdowns and allow Deebo Samuel to score a huge long touchdown that was exacerbated due to a missed tackle by Julian Love. If the Seahawks wish to stop the Falcons high-powered offense, they must shore up their run defense and outpace them in order to have any chance of winning.
