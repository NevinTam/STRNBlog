    1. Offensive woes continue...

The Seattle Seahawks were not able to score any points in the 2nd half against the Denver Broncos. This was expected to be no issue entering Week 2 against the 49ers however, even with 6 days of preparation, the Seattle Seahawks couldn't muster a single point on offense. The Seahawks' only points were on a blocked field goal by Tariq Woolen, taken to the house by Micheal Jackson. 6 quarters with limited first downs and no field goals let alone touchdowns is unacceptable and needs to be ironed out if the Seahawks have any chance of beating the Falcons.

2. Sloppy First Half

The Seahawks have gotten off very slow in the first half this season. On defense, against the Broncos they allowed 7+ yards per carry, but in the second half, it had fallen to under 4. This time their sloppy play continued against the 49ers, not only in the form of the defense but in all 3 units. The defense allowed the first touchdown of the game on a complete-blown coverage to Ross Dwelley, the TE replacing George Kittle, who snuck past Jordyn Brooks and leaped over Quandre Diggs for an easy touchdown. The offense, as previously stated, could not get anything going but more importantly broke the first rule of "Pete-ball" by turning the ball over. Geno Smith was continuously praised by Pete Carroll for taking only safe throws, but in the loss, Geno chose to take a risky throw that got batted up by a defender into a Niners' hands. If both the offense and defense weren't bad enough for breaking Pete's principle rules, the special teams made sure to cement this as a horrendous first half. The Special Teams had Tyler Lockett return a punt but as newly promoted CB Xaiver Crawford was blocking he ran into Lockett, for the ball to fall and land in a Niners' hand. From then on Special Teams was not returning any punts or kickoffs past the 20-yard line showing unacceptable blocking.

3. Missed Tackles (again)

Another issue that has persisted since the preseason has been poor tackling. Carroll has repeatedly assured it was the backups who missed tackling but as evidenced by the last 2 Seahawks games that are most definitely not the case. The area the Seahawks seem to miss the most tackles is in the run game and short passing situations. It was seen numerous times of Seahawks "flying" past ball carriers, unable to wrap them up allowing in many runs past 5 yards that could have been TFLs. The defense was not the only place where Seattle missed tackles. After punting you could see special teamers lining up to tackle the returner, but again flying too fast, they missed allowing for an extra 5-10 yards. This issue needs to be thoroughly focused on during practice or the Seahawks will set up themselves in unfavorable situations.

4. The Offensive Line

The offensive line was supposed to start slow and become a cohesive unit later in the year, but today in every aspect of the game they were bullied by San Francisco's front-7. Only able to generate an average of 2.5 yards a carry for its two starting RBs, Seattle's run game was nonexistent the entire game. This may be in part Waldron's fault, but Waldron cannot commit to a game that is not assisting in moving the chains. There is no excuse as the Seahawks had a fully healthy duo in Rashaad Penny and Kenneth Walker III ready to run the rock. The offensive line was not any better in pass protection either as they surrendered 2 sacks and numerous hits and hurries. Almost every play there was a defender in the backfield, resulting in Smith throwing it out in a hurry, which resulted in a few interception-worthy plays including his actual interception, or taking the sack indirectly ending the drive. There were also unacceptable penalties that brought back plays including Abraham Lucas being an ineligible man 7 yards down the field during a monster catch by DK Metcalf that would've changed the game's momentum entirely. During his post-game interview, Pete Carroll repeatedly expressed the frustration the coaches had because they were not able to use anything they game planned because they couldn't win in the trenches.

5. Shane Waldron...

Without Wilson, it is clear Waldron has been able to open the offense a lot more, but how much is too much? The Seahawks had 4 running backs on one play in the 10 with a running back pushing Geno Smith into a wide receiver position and were able to get 5 yards on it. Waldron excited by the success decided to run another play inside the 5 with 40 personnel. Walker took the snap and handed it to Dallas, the former high school QB, who attempted to throw it in front of an open Metcalf but didn't put any arc on the ball resulting in it ending straight up in a defender's hand. That was the only time the Seahawks were able to get in the redzone and they left without any points because their OC wanted to try something new. Pete Carroll even admitted looking back he tried to call a timeout before the play call to get a more appropriate play. The playcalling itself wasn't bad during the game except for that one play, and even though Waldron's plays may have not resulted in large yardage it wasn't his fault in the end.

6. EDGEs but more specifically who is good?

Now looking more specifically at the defensive side of the ball we focus on the EDGEs, a highly touted group entering the season, with expectations through the roof. Entering the end of the second week we know Nwosu has been a sneaky free agency pickup. Nwosu has been the only EDGE able to get consistent pressure and get in the backfield. Only totaling 1 sack, the stat sheet will not show the full effect of Nwosu, as through 2 games he is the only one who can say he has as many pressures as he has. Taylor on the other hand has arguably much higher expectations than Nwosu coming into the season. Last week Taylor had an excuse for not putting up numbers as the Broncos' offensive line got away with atrocious missed holding penalties, but this week he had no excuse. Darrell Taylor was not able to record any sacks but was able to record 2 TFLs. While this is an improvement there were many times Taylor just got stuck on his block and couldn't get past it. Taylor still has time to turn the season around but as of now, Nwosu looks to take Taylor's former expectations and beat them all the way through the season. Boye Mafe was a key piece as well coming in on a rotation and was able to record the team's only sack. Surprisingly, Mafe was expected to struggle in defending in the run but recorded 4 tackles and was a sound tackler, even against the 49ers' ferocious running back room. It wasn't he was just getting in unblocked but rather a key play that comes to mind was Mafe fighting to keep the edge with a pulled guard, which then as the running back ran towards the outside Mafe disengaged and successfully tackled the running back at the LOS.

7. We. Miss. Jamal.

Jamal Adams is a special player, one who is elite at getting in the backfield when lined up in the box. We know he has coverage issues but those are overblown exaggerations that hide the truth that Jamal is actually above-average in coverage. It was evident we missed him today because we could not tackle to save our life. Jamal and Diggs provide veteran security that almost always won't allow anything to get past them, but with Jamal gone the youth in the team took over. With Josh Jones replacing Jamal and the rest of the team being extremely young, the team was unable to stop people on the first tackle and allowed them to consistently get extra yardage. Jamal was also supposed to have a prized role as hybrid EDGE/Safety in the new scheme, but because of his injuries, Josh Jones played that role. Jones was only sent on a few blitzes early in the game due to the blitzes not being as effective as if Jamal was the one blitzing. Hurtt also may have refrained from sending Jones on blitzes not only because of the lack of results, but also to help stop the defense from giving up large chunk plays. We clearly miss you Jamal and hope you come back better than ever!

8. Rushing Defense Late Start

Against the Denver Broncos, the Seahawks defense on average allowed 5+ yards per carry. In the first half, it was more than 7 yards, but in the second half, they got back to the run defense we know and allowed under 4 yards per carry. Similarly, against the 49ers, in the first half, the Seahawks allowed 19 carries for 122 yards or 6.4 yards per carry. Like last week after halftime, the Seahawks run defense brought the run game average tremendously down. In the second half, the run defense allowed 67 yards on just 26 carries, averaging put to 2.6 yards per carry. The Seahawks seem to struggle against the run in the first half as on average this year they have allowed around 7 yards per run, but in the second half, they are beyond elite at run defense allowing a measly 3.2 ypc. Whatever the coaching staff says to the defense during halftime needs to be said at the beginning of every game in order for the Seahawks to reclaim their spot as one of, if not the best run defense in the NFL.

9. CB Room Depth

The CB Room for the Seattle Seahawks has been met with inconsistent play and injuries over the last 2 years. This year it was starting to look as if things were changing when Artie Burns and Sidney Jones emerged as viable starting cornerbacks. However, after the last month, everything has changed. Artie Burns has been suffering from a groin injury resulting in Tariq Woolen taking his place. Sidney Jones has had a prolonged recovery from a concussion promoting Micheal Jackson as the starter on the left side. Justin Coleman, the team's starting nickel corner, was ruled out as a game-time decision thrusting Coby Bryant into the starting job. While these new corners are filled with youth and immense potential and have shined in their own moments, they are also young and have made many mistakes that have cost big yardage. Coby Bryant has dealt with many penalties as he has countless times used his hands to pull on the receiver causing an instant flag. Woolen struggled in his first game but didn't draw any penalties in his second, showing vast improvement. Micheal Jackson also impressed in his first game but on Sunday against the 49ers, he struggled with turning around in time and keeping his hands off the receiver causing two costly defensive pass interference penalties. This cornerback's room starters are young with potential, but also primed for mistakes. Even when Artie Burns and Sidney Jones return we can expect some promising plays, and some questionable ones for the still relatively young 27 and 26 year olds, respectively.

This week revealed every struggle the Seahawks had and exposed it to the entire world. Even other things in the NFL, like every other division member, winning and the Broncos barely beating the Texans, hurt the Seahawks. If the Seahawks want to win against the 0-2 Falcons they will need to capitalize on their limited success and fix their detrimental errors.
