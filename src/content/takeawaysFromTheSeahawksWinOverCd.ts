**Offensive Successes:**

**Geno Smith**  
Thanks for reading SeahawksToday! Subscribe for free to receive new posts and support my work.  



The best QB in the NFC is not Tom Brady or Aaron Rodgers, but the highly efficient performer Geno Smith. Realistically, for a quarterback, you can easily say Geno Smith has had a better season than Jared Goff, PJ Walker (or any of the other Panthers quarterbacks), Justin Fields, Kyler Murray, Aaron Rodgers, Andy Dalton, Matthew Stafford, Tom Brady, Carson Wentz (or Taylor Heinicke), Marcus Mariota, Jimmy Garoppolo, Daniel Jones, Cooper Rush (or Dak Prescott), and Kirk Cousins. The list above states Geno Smith is better than 14 of the 15 other NFC quarterbacks. The only quarterback who has the advantage over Geno Smith is Jalen Hurts, a potential MVP candidate, similar to Geno. Hurts still have fewer passing yards, passing TDs, and just one less interception than Geno Smith, while also having a lower passer rating. You can see Smith is the better quarterback at passing, but not the best quarterback overall because the quarterback position also includes the quarterback rushing game. That was evident on Sunday as Geno did not record any interceptions, only posting 1 over his last 5 games. While his completion percentage fell to 67.1%, a number that would rank 7th among all quarterbacks if the percentage stayed true the whole year. His completion percentage against the Chargers slightly edges out Jalen hurts, Patrick Mahomes, Justin Herbert, and Aaron Rodgers, if carried out for an entire year. We all know Geno Smith is an elite quarterback, and week 8 only cemented his status as one of the top-tier quarterbacks in the NFC, and more broadly, the entire league.

**Offensive Line**

The highly-touted Kayvon Thibodeaux was expected to be a good challenge for the Seahawks' rookie duo of Charles Cross and Abraham Lucas. But the Seahawks' offensive tackles performed strongly, only allowing him to 2 pressures and zero sacks. They also were good enough in the run game, helping Kenneth Walker and Travis Homer whenever possible, except the yardage and yards per attempt may not be there due to the weaker game from the interior offensive line. Austin Blythe got injured early in the game and was playing well before, but Kyle Fuller played the majority of the snaps after that and played serviceable enough to not warrant Blythe being rushed back into the game. Damien Lewis seemed to have played fine without any game-changing issues and the RG position rotated from Gabe Jackson to Phil Haynes because Jackson seemed to have been on a "snap count". Overall, lanes were nearly impossible to find, and the Seahawks will need to drastically improve their run blocking as they struggled against the NFL's worst run defense in terms of yards allowed per carry. The struggles of the lineman in run-blocking may be partially due to Kyle Fuller, a center with limited experience in the Waldron scheme, who may have struggled to communicate correct details to each lineman.

**Tyler Lockett**

Tyler Lockett has yet again, posted a solid season under the radar from most NFL fans except for Seattle's loyal, but this game he created history, however, not in a good way. Tyler Lockett has his first-ever career fumble lost on October 30th, 2022. That is more than 2600 days since he played his first NFL snap on September 13th, 2015 without allowing a single fumble to be lost. To make matters worse, that fumble also gifted the Giants the ball on the Seahawks' 2-yard line, allowing them to score their only touchdown of the day. To make matters worse, Lockett had a wide-open touchdown catch, in which he miscalculated the ball, allowing it to hit his helmet just before it landed in his hands, causing the ball to bounce off his helmet to the turf. That was on 3rd and 5, which turned the drive to fourth down, leading to a field goal. There were numerous pictures of Lockett looking down on the bench, but also many more of teammates like Geno Smith, and coaches like Pete Carroll, empathetically talking to Lockett in hopes to get his mindset in the right place for the remainder of the game. With those talks Lockett came out with a fresh mindset, redeeming himself by catching a touchdown a similar concept to the one he dropped before, showing his true veteran leadership by being able to bounce back and help the team secure the victory. This was clearly an outlier game for Lockett, and perhaps it was redeemed eventually throughout the game, but expect nothing similar to the mistakes Lockett had for the rest of the season.



**Defensive Turnaround:**

**Cody Barton**

Cody Barton played a lot better, partly because he never committed any atrocious mistakes and he almost reeled in an interception. Barton had 6 total tackles, his first QB hit of the year since week 1, and his second pass defended all year. His total snap count for the game reined at 51%, well shy of the 96.7% he was averaging during the first 3 weeks, but on par with the last 3 weeks. He also was good in coverage only allowing 1 completion on 2 targets for a combined 12. If the defense wants to continue to play well keeping Barton off during obvious passing downs and putting him on the field during obvious run downs, in which he has played well during the last couple of weeks, may be the way to progress through the season.

**Jordyn Brooks**

Jordyn also grew from his prior successes, only allowing 2 completions on 3 targets for 19 yards in coverage, his most obvious weakness. He also cleaned up his tackling as he did not record a single missed tackle during the game, and went his only third game without a miss all season, his first since week 4. In coverage, Brooks allowed his second lowest amount of yards all season, in which his lowest was 12 during the Cardinals game, the start of the turnaround. He also performed exceptionally in the run game, helping allow Barkley to only 2.6 yards per carry, his lowest of the season. On the day, Brooks had 5 tackles, all of which were without assistance, making them all solo tackles. If Brooks seemed to have found his groove in coverage and continues to perform as well as he had in the run defense, the center of the defense, and thus the rest of the defense will play well as a cohesive unit.

**Uchenna Nwosu**

Enter Uchenna Nwosu, the under-the-radar free agent signing who has now posted 5 sacks in 8 games, on pace for 10.5 sacks over the entire season. Comparing Nwosu to the true top-tier elite NFL pass rushers we can see how well Nwosu has performed given his environment versus others.  

NFL Pass Rushers through 8 weeks:  
(Gold = Leads or ties the 6 Rushers for first in a statistic, Silver = Second Place, Bronze = Third Place, Red = Fourth Place, Green = Fifth Place, Blue = 6th place).

(The lower number the better for overall rankings)

Obviously, Nwosu is not a top-tier pass rusher, but as shown above there is a gap, but not too much of a large one. Nwosu has 5 sacks compared to the other rusher's average of 7.1. He has a 6 pressure less average than the other rushers. He has on average 8 more tackles than the other rusher's averages. He had a score of 13, 5 under the rest, or an extra 5th place in the rankings essentially. The statistical gap between pressures and sacks may be because Nwosu has had more targets as a rusher than every single one of them. The only person who comes close is Micah Parsons, who has had 8 targets. In Nwosu's case, he is required to drop into coverage more, thus having fewer pass-rushing opportunities to obtain sacks and pressures. He also was at a disadvantage because for the majority of the year so far, Nwosu had suffered from a bad run defense, giving him and the rest of the defense fewer opportunities on pass-rushing snaps. For all we know, if given the same opportunity as the others, in terms of pass-rushing snaps and a better supporting cast, Nwosu might be much closer to the elite top-tier pass rushers than most people think. Uchenna Nwosu continued his good game against the Los Angeles Chargers as he recorded 2 sacks and 2 pressures. He also was getting put in coverage more frequently recently, and statistically improved in coverage vastly from prior weeks. From weeks 6-7, Nwosu allowed 4 completions on 6 attempts for a 66% completion percentage allowed. In week 8, Nwosu was only targetted once and did not allow the completion, producing a 0% completion percentage allowed. While it was only 1 target, this also may be because Nwosu was better in coverage, forcing quarterbacks to look in another direction, and limiting the total targets Nwosu received.

The Seahawks have only improved since the start of the season and the Giant's game was no exception. These players have gotten better and more comfortable in the new schemes on offense and defense, resulting in a winning team. Some players have continued to show out, while others in recent weeks have emerged as good or above-average players. The Seahawks will need to keep this going entering week 9 against the NFC West division rival Arizona Cardinals.
