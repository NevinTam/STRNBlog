People were very concerned when the Seattle Seahawks drafted a running back with their SECOND ROUND pick, but if we take a closer look we can see it was a good choice. We will look at positional strength, which players make the roster and which don't, and the reasoning behind each player that does make it.

**Rashaad Penny**

After a historic performance in the back half of the 2021 season, Penny is primed for the starting role as the Seahawks RB1. In only 6 games he rushed for 702 yards, generating a lead-leading 6.3 YPC. During this stretch, he was among the league leaders in explosive runs, capping off many 10+ and 20+ yard gains to help boost the Seahawk's rushing attack to the top of the league by the end of the season. However, injuries have hurt Penny in the past, and there are doubts if his health can hold up for an entire season.

**Kenneth Walker III**

The Seahawks selected Kenneth Walker with the ?41 overall pick in the 2nd round. Widely regarded as one of the best running backs in the draft, Walker possesses rare agility that makes him extremely evasive as a rusher, rushing for over 1500 yards in his final year with Michigan State. The Seahawk's rationale for selecting Walker could be to reinforce the RB room for the future, as presumed starter Rashaad Penny is on the last year of his deal, and provide insurance policy as Penny has suffered many injuries during his career. Whatever the reason for selecting Walker, the Seahawks can start using him immediately as a rookie and potentially even more in 2023.

**Travis Homer**

Travis Homer has played well as the Seahawk's 3rd-down back for the past 3 seasons since he entered the league in 2019. His pass protection skills and pass-catching ability are valuable in Shane Waldron's offense. His special team's skills have become increasingly useful, as he has had multiple big plays while on special teams coverage. Look for him to continue his 3rd-down back role while staying a force on special teams.

**Deejay Dallas**

Deejay Dallas has been with the Seahawks for 2 seasons and was a key part of their kick return game as the designated returner for much of the season. He also flashed important pass-protecting skills and was able to make a big difference when given the ball on key drives. Examples of this include during the 2nd Rams game this past season, where multiple RBs were injured and Dallas was able to score the lone Seahawks touchdown of the night. In Week 11 against the Cardinals, he did this feat again and scored the lone Seahawks touchdown of the game.

**Josh Johnson**

Josh Johnson is the 2nd year RB out of UL Monroe who was on the Seahawks practice squad for much of the season and was only able to suit up for a handful of games during the 2021 season, and he only played a handful of snaps. Johnson could be a key depth piece for the Seahawks who could see some more playing time with the inevitable injuries that come at that position.

**Darwin Thompson**

Darwin Thompson was the Seahawk's lone FA addition to the RB room as additional depth ahead of training camp. Thompson spent 2 seasons on the Chiefs and spent the past season on the Tampa Bay Bucs practice squad. If he impresses during training camp, he could find himself a spot on the practice squad with Josh Johnson.

Following the retirement of Chris Carson, the Seahawks RB room is headlined by Rashaad Penny and Kenneth Walker III. Behind them are reliable 3rd down backs in Travis Homer and Deejay Dallas who also provide their services in special teams, and then 2 potential practice squad candidates in Josh Johnson and Darwin Thompson. The Seahawks will look to establish the ground game more this season after trading away Russell Wilson, and much of that depends on the health and efficiency of Rashaad Penny and Kenneth Walker.
