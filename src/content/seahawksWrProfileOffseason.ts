**WR DK Metcalf**

DK Metcalf, the dynamic wide receiver for the Seattle Seahawks, enters the 2023 NFL season as one of the league's premier playmakers. With his exceptional combination of size, speed, and strength, Metcalf has established himself as a dominant force on the field. Since bursting onto the scene in his rookie year, he has consistently showcased his ability to stretch the field and make acrobatic catches, often leaving defenders in his wake. He has recorded 4 straight seasons of 900+ yards, which will make him a big target in his second season with QB Geno Smith. With his potential still untapped, the 2023 season holds great promise for DK Metcalf, as he continues to elevate his game and solidify his status as one of the NFL's elite wide receivers.

**WR Tyler Lockett**

Tyler Lockett, the electrifying wide receiver and deep play threat for the Seattle Seahawks, enters the 2023 NFL season as a key playmaker and fan favorite. Known for his speed, agility, and exceptional route-running ability, Lockett has become a reliable target for quarterback Tyler Lockett. With his remarkable versatility, Lockett has consistently made big plays, whether it's stretching the field with his deep speed or making clutch receptions in critical moments. Over the years, he has showcased his skills as both a deep threat and a reliable possession receiver, making him a nightmare for opposing defenses. Lockett's ability to create separation and find open spaces on the field has made him a vital component of the Seahawks' passing attack. As he enters his ninth season in the NFL, Lockett's status has grown steadily, earning him Pro Bowl honors and respect from his peers. With his exceptional skill set and connection with Smith, Tyler Lockett is poised to significantly impact the 2023 season, leaving fans eagerly anticipating his electrifying performances.

**WR Jaxon Smith Njigba**

Perhaps the biggest addition to the Seahawks WR room in years, Njigba was drafted this past NFL draft with the #20 overall selection by the Seahawks. Seen by many as part of the top-tier wide receivers of the draft, Njigba has a large skillset that makes him perfect for the slot receiver position for the Seahawks, who have struggled to find a consistent contributor there for years. This skillset includes a great burst off the line of scrimmage and incredible agility that makes him perfect for short to intermediate routes, which are frequent at the slot receiver position. This elite agility JSN possesses will be key for him to stand out within this stacked receiving group in his rookie season.

**WR Dee Eskridge**

The Seahawks's 2021 second round pick has not fared well so far in his career. Drafted as an explosive, gadget type of slot receiver, Eskridge has shown flashes of potential but overall it has not translated consistently onto the field. Eskridge has primarily been used as a returner at times and a gadget player in select plays for the offense when he has not been plagued with injuries. Assuming he maintains the WR4 position for the Seahawks, it will be interesting to see what ways they will want to keep him involved in the offense or if they instead to opt for WR Dareke Young for their gadget plays, which they did at times last year.

**WR Dareke Young**

Dareke Young was selected by the Seahawks in the 2022 draft in the 7th round, and has maintained aa roster spot last season. Young was used by the Seahawks as more of a gadget player in his rookie season, at times playing the fullback position alongside his backup receiver role. It is most likely that the Seahawks continue using Young in this role as he further progresses as a wide receiver in his backup role.

**WR Cody Thompson**

Cody Thompson was previously on the Seahawks during the 2021 and 2022 seasons, but only saw small action during the 2021 season through practice squad elevations. Thompson will likely play a similar role hat he did the past seasons, as a practice squad player who could be elevated to play the slot WR position in case of injury.

**WR Cade Johnson**

Cade Johnson was one of the Seahawk's highly touted undrafted signings two offseasons ago, but unfortunately has not been able to see much play time in the Seahawks depth chart. He has been on the Seahawks practice squad for almost his entire tenure and is likely to remain so this season, available for elevation should there be injury.

**WR Easop Winston Jr.**

Easop Winston Jr is an NFL veteran who has spent his time in the league on various practice squads, starting with Rams and later the Saints and Browns before signing with the Seahawks this past season. He has seen very little gameday activity, only playing in one NFL game.

**WR Jake Bobo**

Jake Bobo was one of the Seahawks recent undrafted free agent signings following the 2023 NFL Draft. Bobo played college football at Duke and later UCLA. In College he received third-team all ACC in 2021. Bobo will likely be fighting for a practice squad spot in a stacked Seahawks receiver position group, but could be brought back next offseason to compete if he does not make the practice squad this year.

**WR Matt Landers**

Landers is another undrafted free agent the Seahawks signed after the 2023 NFL Draft. Landers played at several colleges, such as Georgia, Toledo, and Arkansas. Like Bobo, he is likely to fight for a practice squad spot amid the intense competition.

**WR Tyjon Lindsey**

Tyjon Lidsey is another undrafted signee by the Seahawks, hailing from Oregon State University. He has great speed and could be used by the Seahawks as a return man or backup return man on the practice squad in favor of his return skills for now, giving him more versatility and a higher chance to not be cut from the team and not be brought back to the practice squad.

**WR John Hall**

The final Seahawks undrafted WR signee, Hall played at Norwood University where he showed his big frame and explosiveness. He could make big plays within the Seahawks training camp and secure himself a spot on the practice squad or find himself cut by the Seahawks during the preseason as the rosters shorten.
