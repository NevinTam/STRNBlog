The Seahawks snapped their 3 game skid with a huge win over the Atlanta Falcons, moving the Seahawks back into first place in the NFC West. Read below for our takeaways of the game!

**Offense Gains Consistency, Geno Looks Sharp**

The offense looked primed today to make a comeback after multiple poor outings against the Giants and Niners. Geno immediately carved up the Falcons defense with several intermediate throws, balanced with a strong rushing attack from K9, leading to 10 points before a beautiful TD pass from Geno to DK Metcalf to close out the half. Afterwards, the Seahawks were able to add onto their score, including with a one-handed TD grab by K9 to help ramp up the pressure on the Falcons offense. The offensive line of the Seahawks played much better in regulating pressure on Smith, allowing him to stay in the pocket and target each of his receivers. The right side of the offensive line (Rookies Christian Haynes and Mike Jerrell) even paved a huge lane for K9 on his first touchdown of the day.

**Defense Holds Up** 
While the defense still had some struggles defending the run, the addition of Byron Murphy II helped anchor the defense and the pass rush, which was able to perform well against a formidable Atlanta offensive line. The pass rush was able to effectively put the game out of reach with a Derrick Hall fumble return TD late in the 3rd quarter. When the defense was able to be put in obvious passing downs, they were able to flourish, recording two more interceptions before the end of the game. Being able to limit the offenseâ€™s rushing capabilities or just forcing more passing opportunities will significantly help the Seahawks defense next week against a stout Bills team.
