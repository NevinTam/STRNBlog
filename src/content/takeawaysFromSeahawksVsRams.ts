**Offense**

The offense was elite for the first quarter and part of the 2nd. They converted 4 on 4 of their 3rd down conversion attempts, even with Ken Walker leaving for injury. After they went 4 for 4, they went 1 for 11, posting a 33% conversion rate on the game. At least they ended 2 for 2 on 4th down conversions in the game. They held the ball more than the Rams and punted the ball less. So, why did Seattle only muster 16 points on a game where they were really strong on offense? Well, the few drives after their 4 of 4 3rd down conversions were drives where they struggled to move the ball. Then, Geno Smith was tackled by Aaron Donald and injured his tricep on his throwing arm, causing him to leave the game. Drew Lock entered and was abysmal, throwing the ball 6 times for 2 completions and 1 interception. Geno Smith entered the game on the last drive and drove down the field for a Jason Myers game-winning field goal. Alas, Myers missed the field, leaving the Seahawks down a point with the Rams taking a knee. A huge reason why the Seahawks were the better offense during the game but did not end with more points were penalties. Penalties were called and accepted on the Seahawks 12 times in their loss against the Rams, totaling 130 yards. Many of the penalties called came on 3rd down, something unacceptable for a team that is trying to sustain drives and convert points after a month of struggling to do so. Geno Smith played another good game after his strong performance against the Commanders and was not the reason the Seahawks lost this game.

**Defense**

The defense was dominant for the majority of this game. They held the Rams to 2 for 9 on 3rd down and 0 for 1 on 4th down. The Rams offense had fewer plays on offense, less time of possession, and more punts. The Rams were held to 7 points with under 8 minutes left to play, but with the offense's massive struggle to stay on the field in the 2nd half, the defense was forced on the field for most of the 2nd half. Staying on the field for too long during the 2nd half caused the Seahawks defense to get worn out with a full half of being on the field, leading them to break midway through the 4th quarter. The run defense of the Seahawks started to break down, and unacceptable penalties kept them on the field and sustained drives for the Rams, allowing them to score. If this Seahawks team wants to certify themselves as a contender in the NFL, they will need to be the 49ers and the ensuing games. This can only happen by getting off the field on 3rd downs on defense.

The story of the game continues with the pass rush. The pass rush was lights out on their first few drives, recording a sack and multiple QB pressures. They were able to easily beat up on a weak Rams offensive line. After the first portion of the game, however, the Seahawks generated almost no pass rush on the QB Matthew Stafford. The only form of pass rush came on an extended play where Mario Edwards somehow got free and bull-rushed Matthew Stafford at full speed, almost knocking him out of the game. For a team that just made a huge move to acquire a star DE in Leonard Willians, they expect their pass rush to show out throughout the whole game, not just the first few drives of the game.
