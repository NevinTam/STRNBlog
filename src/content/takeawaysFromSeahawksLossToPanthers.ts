**Run Defense**

After playing well for the first 2 quarters of the game, the Seahawks' run defense entirely collapsed with Al Woods returning to the locker room with an injury. If Al Woods does not return to the Seahawks' game against the 49ers, the Seahawks will have a near 0% chance of winning the game. Poona Ford was one snap away from playing his second-highest total of the season, his highest since the first 49ers game. Shelby Harris remained out and Quinton Jefferson is more specialized in pass-rushing. Bryan Mone played 32 snaps but was ultimately a nonfactor. Al Woods is the clear center of this defensive line and has been for his entire Seattle tenure. It will not matter who is at quarterback because they will need to hand it off to the running backs, in fact, George Kittle could start at QB and still lead the '9ers to a win. The Seahawks ran with 2 linebackers more than ever in recent weeks because there was no need for Coby Bryant to be on the field in the nickel formation. The Seahawks feel open to putting Barton on the field due to his improved coverage skills, but he still gets destroyed in the run game. Barton sees his snaps to help in the coverage game, but the opposing teams choose to run because Barton is unable to find gaps where the opponent's running backs will run through, and thus ends up in an area nowhere near the ball. Barton is a liability in run defense, and along with the Seahawks' 2-man fronts without Al Woods, there are too many gaps for running backs to run through and Barton to miss those open gaps.

**Run Offense**

While I cannot provide too much blame on the running backs, the Seahawks' run game was nonexistent and has been for the last few games. In prior weeks it was a combination of injuries to the running backs, poor offensive line blocking, and running backs hesitating to "make their own gap" by bulldozing through. All of these factors led the Seahawks to have their poorest stretch of the run game of the year. Against the Panthers most of these factors were present. Kenneth Walker III and DeeJay Dallas were both out. Travis Homer had returned for his first game since his injury and played 40+ snaps. There was no room for Homer to run due to a strong Panthers' front-7 beating the Seahawks' offensive line off the block, closing any potential gaps for Homer to find, resulting in a 2.9 yards per carry average for Homer. Injuries and poor blocking played a role and Homer didn't seem to have trouble finding the nonexistent gaps, proving to the Seahawks that their offensive running game has had the same problems for numerous weeks. Kenneth Walker III is expected to return against a ferocious San Francisco defense, and an even more dangerous front-7, headlined by Fred Warner, Nick Bosa, Arik Armstead, and Dre Greenlaw. The Seahawks will mainly need to be better at creating push at the line of scrimmage and Walker will need to commit to a partial open gap, or create his own, rather than waiting for a gap to arise and getting tackled for loss instead.

**Rookie Tackles**

Abraham Lucas and Charles Cross continue to be 2 of the top 5 best rookie tackles on the season. Neither allowed a sack or commented a penalty against the Panthers. This is a formidable achievement knowing they were going against renowned pass-rusher Brian burns, a former potential trade target for all teams across the NFL, including the Seahawks. Both players have had their PFF grade increase in the last week, including in the Run Blocking category, a statistic that shows the offensive line struggles cannot be fully placed upon them. They still need to impress in run-blocking, but coming out of college it is expected that they would need time to grow into an NFL playbook and scheme. With 4 remaining games left on the season, both tackles are clear competitors in the Pro Bowl race for the NFC team and will need to close out the season as strong tackles amidst a weak offensive line.

**Geno Smith**

Geno Smith had the worst game of his season, and arguably his worst since 2014, his last full year as a starter. On the first play of the game, he threw an interception as he failed to see Jaycee Horn lurking around his target Tyler Lockett. After his interception he seemed to have warmed up and started to throw better passes and threw a touchdown. Then before you know it he had thrown another one, but it was an understandable one that most people agree was not his fault. It seemed the defense had blatantly jumpwed offsides so Geno carelessly threw the ball up into double coverage with a chance to make a play. if the ball had been incomplete they would accept the penalty. But the referees never called any offsides, even though the announcers and every fan in the stadium was calling gfor it, resulting in Geno's second interception. pte Caroll and Geno Smith bot addressed it in their postgame press conference saying they belived it to have been "free play", but unluckily they missed out. Geno went on to to throw 2 more touchdowns during the game and threw for a total 264 yards for 3 touchdowns compared to 2 interception. Geno Smith may be trying to do too much, a similar pattern to what happened to Russell Wilson's final games of the Let Russ Cook movement. He seems to be forcing throws in the middle to deep areas of the field, rather than taking what is given to him. While he has been able to complete these throws due to elite quarterback play and top-tier wide receivers, a few unlucky plays have warranted him to go back to the simple play that allowed him to put up strong numbers and take care of the ball. Geno also addressed this in his post game press conference and believed he was trying to do much (which was still working because of his pure talent and skills), but wanted to gear it back and start taking what the defense gives him more, rather than putting the ball at any risk for the defense to capitalize on.
