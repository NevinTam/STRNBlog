**Seahawks WRs vs Washington CBs**

The Seahawks WRs have been going through a small dry spell lately. With Metcalf and Lockett battling through hip/hamistring injuries, their production has taken a huge hit with the rest of the offense. JSN has been the most consistent reciever on this team since the bye week, which is great to see how his chemistry with Geno Smith has increased week-by-week. This game against the Commanders will likely be a good get-right game as the Washington CBs, headlined by Kendall Fuller, Benjamin St Juste, and Danny Johnson, have been one of the most picked on secondary's in the league, as the Commanders have given up the 27th most passing yards through 9 weeks.

**Seahawks CBs vs Washington WRs**

The Seahawks cornerback group, headlined by CBs Tariq Woolen, Devon Witherspoon, and Tre Brown, looks to rebound from last game against the Ravens with this matchup. While they did not play a bad game, and were able to force a turnover, they did not play up to their usual standard and were getting picked on for extra YAC. They will have another tough matchup going against the Commanders, with WRs Terry McLaurin, Jahan Dotson, and Curtis Samuel. A formidable trio, they have played well in recent weeks with QB Sam Howell. McLaurin is one of the league's best contested catchers, and Samuel is a great YAC weapon, which have hurt the Seahawks quite a bit in the past few weeks. Dotson has also emerged as a great intermediary threat that can be used from the slot to generate huge plays.

**Seahawks RBs vs Washington Front 7**

The Seahawks rushing game was essentially non-existent in last week's blowout vs the Ravens. The run game must be better when playing against Washington, which has about an average run defense. Look for the Seahawks to try to establish the run again after last week to help alleviate any pressure on Geno. The Seahawks may also try to use a more shifty Walker over Charbonnet, as the Washington linebackers have not played very well in space this season. If Walker could force a few missed tackles, he could break a huge run off and break his scoring drought.

**Seahawks Pass Rush vs Washington Pass Protection+ QB Sam Howell**

Staring off the season, Sam Howell was on pace to record the most sacks taken in a single season in NFL History. A huge part of this however, was Howell's indecision and taking a huge number of sacks early in the season. As the season wore on, he was able to improve his timing, making this not quite the slam dunk for the pass rush as many believe. However, the Seahawks will need to keep pressure on Howell to ensure he doesn't dice up the defense with intermediate or short throws. Currently, Howell is 2nd in the NFL in passing yards, making him a dangerous threat when given time. With the Seahawks pass rush adding Leonard Williams and Frank Clark in recent weeks, hopefully they will be able to put enough pressure to force a few errant throws on the Commanders QB. Boye Mafe, who is quickly becoming one of the best pass-rushers on the team, is currently on a historical streak and looks to continue it with his 7th sack in 7 games.
