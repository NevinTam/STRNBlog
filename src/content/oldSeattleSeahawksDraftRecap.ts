    **Seattle Seahawks Draft Recap and Grades**
===========================================

The Seattle Seahawks entered the draft with a fan base that had no clear vision of the direction of the franchise and left with a fanbase excited by the Seahawks' smart and valuable picks across all 3 days. These will be grades from a true Seattle fan, not someone that think Seattle's first and only need is QB.

**Charles Cross, OT, 1.09**

Charles Cross, also known as "Sweet Feet", is someone we had predicted in our "Last Minute Seattle Seahawks Mock Draft" to become a member of the Seattle Seahawks. This was an amazing pick as Seattle had been unable to resign Duane Brown and their current starter for LT was Stone Forsythe, the 6th round pick from 2021 who has played extremely minimal snaps in his career. Cross will be a franchise left tackle for whoever starts under center for many years to come.

**Grade: A+**

Where we predicted the first 2 picks correctly: 

**Boye Mafe, EDGE, 2.40**

The second and sadly, last player we had correctly mocked to us was Boye Mafe, the 40th pick in the draft. A player who fits a dire need for a team that ranked near the bottom of the league in sacks. Mafe was mocked to go near the end of the first round but managed to fall to pick 40, where the Seattle Seahawks did not hesitate and took him. Mafe however, will be 24 in November making him a much older rookie. Regardless, an excellent pick from PCJS and company.

**Grade: B+**

**Kenneth Walker, RB, 2.41**  

![](https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/29093b87-e5ed-4ee2-be40-af4a04789918_700x393.jpeg)

A common characteristic of drafts in Pete Caroll and John Schneider drafts is always one pick that makes everyone question what PCJS are doing. While in this draft, there wasn't such an obvious player, Kenneth Walker was someone that could be considered confusing at first. However, no one is doubting Walker's talent, as he's clearly one of the best RBs in the draft. With Rashaad Penny and Chris Carson on the last year of their deal, it makes sense that RB is a need. However, the question remains, did Seattle make a RB selection too early when there was other talent still left on the board?

**Grade: B-**

**Abraham Lucas, OT, 3.72**  

![](https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/625a2e1c-e2e9-44ea-a5fe-82cbf5c8539d_700x393.jpeg)

Abraham Lucas is an offensive tackle out of Washington State and one of the best pass-protecting tackles in the entire draft. Lucas was great value at the top of Round 3 and can be a day one starter at right tackle, and can easily be a multi-year solid starting lineman. Lucas and Charles Cross at right and left tackle can be the defining points in a rebuilt Seahawk offensive line.

**Grade: A**

**Coby Bryant, CB, 4.109**  

![](https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/f6451497-95c7-4278-b042-efc4b4f7934c_700x393.jpeg)

Coby Bryant was a Cincinnati CB who played alongside highly touted CB prospect Sauce Gardner, who went very high in the first round. While Gardner received plenty of hype this year, Bryant was one of the best CB's in the nation, winning the Jim Thorpe award given to the best DB in the nation. Bryant is a young player with a high floor, which will help him gain valuable snaps in a CB group lacking a clear CB1.

**Grade: A-**

**Tariq Woolen, CB, 5.153**  

![](https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/d022ff8b-7749-4686-a3ce-069819068f3e_700x393.jpeg)

Tariq Woolen out of UTSA is an extremely rare type of athlete, being 6 foot 4 while also running a 4.26 40-yard dash. These athletic traits are almost impossible to come by and truly show how high of a ceiling Woolen has. However, he transitioned to CB only 2 years ago so he will have plenty to work on during his time with the Seahawks, but overall Woolen was great value all the way in the 5th round for the Seahawks.

**Grade: A**

**Tyreke Smith, EDGE, 5.158**  

![](https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/f8d1d474-3f45-4f30-b5b9-b1b054d5dd0c_700x479.jpeg)

Tyreke Smith out of Ohio State gives Seattle much-needed pass rush depth at good value for the 5th round. Smith has had decent production against high-level college competition and could easily be able to grab a handful of snaps per game as part of this new edge rush rotation.

**Grade: B**

**Bo Melton, WR, 7.229**  

![](https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/680a4d04-ce6b-42ff-bdb7-a29bd7a21ad2_700x366.jpeg)

Bo Melton from Rutgers was a player many had to go in the 5th or even earlier, making this pick one with great value for Seattle. He's a speedy receiver that can be explosive with the ball in his hands, making him good depth at slot WR behind presumed starter Dwayne Eskridge. Melton could also be a key contributor on special teams on kick and punt coverage right away.

**Grade: A**

**Dareke Young, WR, 7.233**  

![](https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/fd1ee824-9856-4d93-ba9f-1e2ae73ff249_700x463.jpeg)

Dareke Young is the 2nd WR the Seahawks took in the 7th Round to add further depth to their WR group. Young is physical WR that along with Melton will have to go through a training camp battle in order to make the 53-man roster. Young is only 22, however, and has plenty of potential to become a key part of Seattle's WR rotation.

**Grade: B**

The Seahawks had an excellent 2022 draft and arguably their best one since their legendary 2012 draft class when they selected 2 Hall of Famers in Bobby Wagner and Russell Wilson. However, in 2022, the Seahawks instead opted to choose to upgrade key positions on both sides of the ball, investing resources heavily at tackle, edge rusher, and cornerback. If anything, this draft could draw parallels to Seattle's 2010 and 2011 drafts, where they took the best players at places where they had holes on the roster which preceded the culminating draft of a QB. After this draft, a similar vibe can be felt in Seattle, where there is more hope for the future now than there has been for the last few years.
