**Run Defense**  
Thanks for reading SeahawksToday! Subscribe for free to receive new posts and support my work.  

The run defense took a massive step forward in the game following a showing where they were exploited by a running back room led by D'Onta Foreman and Chubba Hubbard. They allowed rookie Jordan Mason and veteran Christain McCaffrey to combine for 172 yards on 30 carries, for 5.73 yards per carry. That may seem as if the Niners were able to run all over the Seahawks, but if you take out the game-closing run by Jordan Mason of 56 yards, the total drops to 116 yards on 29 carries, for exactly 4 yards a carry, the league average. The 56-yard run was in the final minutes of the game when the Seahawks needed to stop the Niners from converting for a first-down if they wanted to have a chance at winning. Resulting in the Seahawks stacking the box, and only putting Ryan Neal off the line of scrimmage, who missed the tackle, and allowed Mason to run for 56 yards. The Seahawks' run defense turned the corner, turning one of the most star-powered offenses highlighted by an elite running back and strong run blockers, into a league-average attack for the Thursday Night Football game. This was a run defense without its two nose tackles because Al Woods wasn't able to suit up for the game, and Bryan Mone tore his ACL 5 snaps into the game. A mix of Shelby Harris, Poona Ford, and Quinton Jefferson, a group of mainly 3-4 defense ends, not tackles, were able to clog up gaps for the majority of the game. The hope will be Al Woods is able to return and provide a secure anchor to an unstable Seahawks' defensive line. The Seahawks will most likely NOT need a strong run defense against the Chiefs, highlighted by the best quarterback of the 2022 season, Patrick Mahomes.

**Quandre Diggs**

Quandre Diggs has taken a step back from his prior season as a Seattle Seahawk. He still has a chance to record his third interception of the season, which would make him the only player to record 3 interceptions in the last 6 seasons. He could have recorded that on Thursday but dropped the easiest interception of his career because the ball hit his chest before it reached his arms. Diggs is playing like an average safety this season as he hasn't recorded a high amount of interceptions, but is still playing well in coverage allowing near league-low completion percentage for safeties. Diggs missed interception completely titled the game for the Seahawks because if Quandre was able to catch it around the 50-yard line, he could have returned it for an easy 10 yards, automatically putting the Seahawks in field goal range. The Seahawks and the 49ers took turns punting to start the game, and that interception would have provided the advantage and the momentum the Seahawks needed to have a chance for the top spot in the NFC West. Diggs may be playing at a worse level due to his safety partner Jamal Adams being out, and the fact that it is a new scheme and the people around him, or himself, may not understand it enough to allow Diggs to play on his own and make a play. He may also be mediocre this season because the run defense has been atrocious so opposing offenses choose to run over pass, lowering Diggs' opportunities for acquiring more interceptions. With other factors that will hopefully improve over another full offseason of hard work geared towards understanding the scheme, the run defense and miscommunication issues may be ironed out, and Adams may return, allowing Diggs to play at his elite level once again.

**Run Offense**

The run offense has struggled since the Seahawks' last dominant win against the Arizona Cardinals. A mix of weak interior offensive line blocking and Walker waiting for the open holes, rather than creating his own, has caused the run offense to fall out and hurt Geno Smith's passing offense. It struggled again with Walker being unable to elapse 50 yards rushing for the 4th straight game, since the second Cardinals matchup. The interior offensive line has completely collapsed, seen getting pushed back 3 yards nearly every running play, ending Walker's chances for a run with positive yardage. The interior offensive line is not the only one to blame as Kenneth Walker III has struggled to take the open hole and get the helpful yardage that sets up future downs as manageable. He consistently waits for the big hole to open up, wanting a highlight reel worthy clip that displays him running full speed for the touchdown, rather than taking the open hole, or using blockers to create his own hole. Charles Cross and Abe Lucas have been sufficient in run blocking as tackles, evident by Kenneth Walker's best runs being ones directed towards the outside, past the tackles and tight ends. The Seahawks' 3 tight ends have done their jobs by being strong run blockers who aren't afraid to send a defensive back or linebacker back a few yards. Damien Lewis has been average at best, but his exceptional play from the Seahawks' win streak has taken a toll, most likely due to Austin Blythe's lack of size showing inconsistency in the run game. The Seahawks have a tandem at right guard with Phil Haynes and Gabe Jackson rotating in to provide security for Gabe Jackson's "old knee". Gabe Jackson has been extremely inconsistent as he has either struggled largely in the pass-blocking game, or played phenomenal. In run blocking, however, he has been more consistent at being a weak run blocker who gets sent behind the line of scrimmage numerous times. Phil Haynes is a more well-rounded player who doesn't suffer immensely in either run or pass blocking. Haynes is an average at best pass-blocker, but a good run-blocker. Austin Blythe is the center of the problem for the lack of potent Seahawks' run offense as he is largely undersized for a center, being sent back and demolished in run blocking. His play on its own has hampered the Seahawks run offense, which has also hampered the playbook and the Seahawks passing and total offense, but his play has also affected the others around him as they seem to struggle when the main key cog in their offensive line struggles because they expect a result when he blocks for it to turn out to be devastating for the play, nearly ending the Seahawks' offensive drive.
