**AJ Brown and DeVonta Smith vs. Riq Woolen**

AJ Brown has cemented himself as one of the top wide receivers in the game. Devonta Smith is one of the young stars in the league and will continue to be better. On the flip side, Riq Woolen is having a sophomore slump, but Woolen is still better in coverage this year than his rookie when he had posted 6 interceptions. Devon Witherspoon is the other star Seahawks corner but is questionable for this game after missing most of last week against the 49ers.

Tre Brown will get the start at outside cornerback if Witherspoon cannot go, and Brown has been good this season, allowing a 63% completion percentage but has 2 pick-sixes on the season. As the 3rd starting cornerback for the Seahawks, some may think Brown doesn't get targeted much because he isn't on the field often, but the truth is Brown has been on the field for nearly 75% of all defensive snaps this season. Despite this, Brown has only allowed 283 yards in coverage in 2023.

Woolen and Witherspoon, or if Witherspoon is unavailable, Brown, will have a tough matchup against one of the best wide receiver duos in the league, who have a combined 2100 receiving yards on the season. Woolen has been stout in coverage but is going up against a top-5 WR in the league and will need to play one of his toughest matchups of the year. If the Seahawks' pass rush is ineffective, Woolen and the corner starting opposite of him will have a tough time covering Brown and Smith for too long.

**Jarran Reed, Leonard Williams, and Dre'Mont Jones vs. Landon Dickerson, Sue Opeta, and Jason Kelce**

Jarran Reed is having a career year at age 31, posting pressure in every game this season except for 1. Leonard Williams has been the Seahawks best defensive player since his arrival midway through the season. Dre'Mont Jones, despite not recording the sacks, has gotten strong pressure numbers this season, despite being moved to EDGE after the Seahawks needed help defending the run after EDGE Uchenna Nwosu was declared out for the season.

Jason Kelce is one of the best centers of all time and is a sure-fire Hall of Famer. Sue Opeta will start for an injured Cam Jurgens who is one of the key pieces on an elite Eagles offensive line. Landon Dickerson has slowly become one of the better guards in the league, despite being drafted as a center.

In all fairness, the Eagles' offensive line is one of the best in the National Football League, and even though the Seahawks' defensive line has beaten up other offenses, most teams they have destroyed have been far weaker offensive lines on bad teams. This Eagles offensive line is the best the Seahawks will face all season, maybe except for the Cleveland Browns offensive line. Leonard Williams will be able to take advantage of a backup guard starting for the Eagles, but he may be double-teamed more due to the Eagles' offense recognizing the weakness amidst their offensive line. Jarran Reed will have a tough matchup against Jason Kelce and if he can get a few pressures and stay present while defending the run, Seattle may have a chance to not get beat up in the trenches.

**Seahawks OL vs. Eagles' Front-7**

The Seahawks have a bad offensive line. The Eagles have an elite front. Despite the Eagles defense struggling this season, they have one of the most talented defenses in the league and should not be underestimated. Seattle has Charles Cross, who has looked like a franchise left tackle in the last few weeks, and Abe Lucas, who has steadily made his return and will play every snap for the first time since 2022.

The interior of the Seahawks offensive line is where the big problems lay. Evan Brown was an All-Pro center earlier in the year, but he has fallen off with the rest of the Seahawks' interior offensive line. Phil Haynes is currently on Injured Reserve, leading Anthony Bradford, a super undeveloped right guard, to start for him. Damien Lewis has been inconsistent this season, despite looking like an above-average left guard for most of the last season.

The Eagles front-7 will be without Zach Cunningham who will have All-Pro Shaquille Leonard start in place of him. The Eagles will have a vaunted defensive line with Haason Reddick, Josh Sweat, Brandon Graham, Jordan Davis, Fletcher Cox, and Jalen Carter. Reddick has 11 sacks on the season. Sweat has 6.5. Brandon Graham has 3 but has missed a lot of time this season. Nose tackle Jordan Davis has 2.5 sacks. Fletcher Cox, despite being 33 years old, has 4 sacks on the season, including 3 in his last 4 games. Potential defensive rookie of the year Jalen Carter has 4 sacks on the season in a limited role on a deep Eagles defensive line.

In other words, the Eagles defensive line will provide a large challenge against a weak Seahawks offensive line, and the only way to not get sacked every time the QB throws the ball is to get the ball out quickly, as they did against the Cowboys where they put up 35 points against a top-5 defense in the NFL.
