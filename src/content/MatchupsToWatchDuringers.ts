    The Seahawks have their first divisional matchup of the year Week 2, going against the San Francisco 49ers in Santa Clara. The 49ers are coming off an ugly loss while in a rainstorm to the Chicago Bears where both teams struggled offensively, whereas the Seahawks managed to pull out a win to upset the Broncos on MNF in the highly anticipated return game for Broncos QB Russell Wilson. In this article we will go into what matchups are key to deciding who could win this game.

The Seahawks rookie OT duo fared decently against the Broncos duo of Randy Gregory and Bradley Chubb, but this week they go against All-Pro Nick Bosa and Arik Armstead. Cross struggled in pass protection as the game wore on, giving up 2 sacks to Broncos edge rusher Bradley Chubb, making it a cause for concern as in week 2 he has to go against an even more elite edge rusher in Nick Bosa. A key part of the pass protection is in the pocket presence of QB Geno Smith, as that is something Smith acknowledged he could be better at during press conferences this week.

**2.49ers Front Seven vs Seahawks O-line and RBs Rashaad Penny and Kenneth Walker**

The 49ers have one of the best front 7's in the league and have been near the top in run defense for the past few seasons. This will make it a big challenge for Penny and Walker to establish an effective run-game, which is what HC Pete Caroll wishes to do with Geno Smith running the offense. If the Seahawks are able to establish an effective running attack, they would be able to control the time of possession battle with long drives, slowly wearing down the 49ers defense.

**3.49ers CBs Chavarious Ward and Emmanuel Mosely vs Seahawks WRs DK Metcalf and Tyler Lockett**

In last week's game against the Broncos, the Seahawks sought to target a weak Broncos LB core by the heavy use of TE's. In the same way, the Seahawks this week may seek to target a weaker 49ers secondary via the use of their elite WR duo. This means the gameplan would be more deep routes to WRs rather than the more short completions we saw Metcalf and Lockett get in Week 1.

**4.49ers Offensive Line and RBs Jeff Wilson Jr. + Jordan Mason vs Seahawks Front Seven**

Just like the Seahawks, the 49ers are a team that loves to establish the run and play a physical brand of football. Such a strategy was what allowed them to get on a hot run during the end of last year and make a run to the NFC Championship game. However, now they have suffered losses on the interior offensive line, making it all the more important that the presence of interior linemen Shelby Harris, Poona Ford, and Al Woods is felt in order to stop this rushing attack. This is especially important because last game against the Broncos, the new 3-4 defense was not effective against the run, making it even more important they neutralize it this week against a potent 49ers run game.

**5.** **Seahawks Interior Pass Rush vs 49ers Interior Offensive Line**

As mentioned before, the 49ers IOL has suffered losses since last season, specifically losing LG Laken Tomlinson in free agency and C Alex Mack to retirement. As such, it is critical that the Seahawks are able to put pressure on Lance from the interior, forcing him out of the pocket where LBs Cody Barton and Jordyn Brooks can help contain him, disrupting the flow of the 49ers offense and forcing more punts.



For the Seahawks to win, they should win multiple of these matchups otherwise it becomes increasingly difficult to keep a steady rhythm on offense *or* defense. By keeping a steady rhythm with the run defense and playing good defense, the Seahawks can win in the "Pete Caroll" way.
