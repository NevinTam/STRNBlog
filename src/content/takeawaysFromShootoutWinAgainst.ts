**Offensive Passing Game**

Rebounding from a downright terrible game last week against the Rams, Geno and the receiving group proved critical in guaranteeing Seattle's win in this game. Geno looked extremely poised as he maneuvered around the pocket and delivered darts to receivers all across the field, but specifically to receivers outside the numbers, opting to use more intermediate outer routes than using the traditional deep ball that we've grown accustomed to under Smith. Smith was extremely accurate and throughout the entire game only had 2 real mistakes. One was a near pick-six in the 3rd quarter that led to a field goal, and a terrible sack late in the game that led to the Lions receiving the ball at midfield, extremely close to field goal position.

The main reason deep balls were likely not in the game plan this week was due to the absence of the Seahawks main two offensive tackles - Charles Cross and Abraham Lucas. Lucas was placed on IR last week, meaning he will be gone for the next 4 weeks and can return week 7 after the bye. Cross has been dealing with a toe injury that has led many to speculate that he will be out for around two-three weeks. In their stead, Jake Curhan and Stone Forsythe replaced the RT and LT respectively, and were able to keep Geno upright all game. They only allowed one sack and QB hit, which were both on the same play where Geno held the ball and take an egregious sack late in the 4th. Besides that, they played lights out in stopping an improving Lions pass-rush spearheaded by Aidan Hutchinson. Hopefully, this translates to next week, where the backup duo will likely be playing against a Panthers pass rush featuring Brian Burns and Derrick Brown.

The Seahawks wide receivers were not featured most of the game and only became a larger part of the offense as the game went on into the 4th quarter where there were repeated strikes to DK Metcalf and two touchdowns to Tyler Lockett. Outside of that, however, the Seahawks employed more 2 and 3 tight end sets, using tight ends within the pass and blocking game, which made Geno throw over 120 yards across his 3 TE weapons, with each supplying valuable receiving value over the course of the game. Will Dissly had several 1st down conversions. Parkinson had clutch 3rd-down conversions late in the game to keep the drive alive. Noah Fant was the most explosive, catching several long passes (including the longest Seahawks play of the day) within the final drives.

**Seahawks Rushing Attack**

While the rushing game struggled this game against the Lions, Kenneth Walker had several key plays to finish or end drives. He was able to score two touchdowns and converted a crucial 4th down for the Seahawks. He often was not provided much space, and was running more side-to-side than vertical, which has been a common occurrence for Walker in his career. Against Detroit though, this is what could have led him to have a lower YPC as he simply had to navigate around the OL looking for holes and gaps.

The difference between Walker and Charbonnet, the Seahawks 2nd round pick, is shown here. Whereas Walker danced around and looked to bust a big play open on several of his carries, Charbonnet elected to rush straight through the hole and utilize his power. This effect was effective at first, allowing him to finish with a 4.0 YPC. However, the Seahawks decided to not use him after a couple drives, instead just going more pass heavy with run plays on select occasions with Walker.

While Walker is a great, top-tier RB talent within the league, the Seahawks should utilize the "lighting/thunder" relationship between both Walker and Charbonnet within the coming weeks, meaning more carries for Charbonnet hopefully next week against the Panthers, who have a stout defense.

**Defense Pass Rush**

The Seahawks entered this game with 0 sacks on the season, allowing their week one opponent Matthew Stafford to have endless time in the pocket. Against a strong offensive line of the Lions, this was not expected to change too much, and it did not. The only time the Seahawks got any remote pressure was one drive that was sparked with a cornerback blitz by Tre Brown that ended with a sack, the first of the season for Seattle. On the following plays, the Seahawks defensive line collapsed the pocket, and after a few spin moves, prized pass-rusher Dre'Mont Jones allowed Goff to end up right in his hands.   

That one drive was the only relative instance of pass rush the entire game, even with the Lions suffering numerous injuries to their starting and backup offensive linemen. The sack leader from last year Uchenna Nwosu has yet to record a sack this year. $51 million richer Dre'Mont Jones earned a sack through Goff running straight into him after several spins. Breakout player second-round pick from last year Boye Mafe did not record a sack in the week one opener and did not play week 2. Darrell Taylor, the pure 3rd down special player, has not recorded one pressure this season even though his run defense has drastically improved.

**Cornerback Play**

After Tariq Woolen left early in the game with a chest injury, Tre Brown entered the game, leaving Seattle with two corners with a combined 5 starts prior to this game. The Lions were expected to pick on the outside corner duo of Devon Witherspoon and Tre Brown, but Goff picked on the linebackers and slot CB, not the outside CBs. Tre Brown recorded an interception, something no one has been able to do of Goff in over 300+ pass attempts, the third-longest streak in NFL history.   

Tre Brown excelled in his 4 starts in his rookie season, and after never getting the opportunity to start again in his sophomore year with the emergence of Michael Jackson Sr. and a horrible injury, Brown has found a nice spot as a starter in Woolen's absence. Brown was targeted 5 times and only allowed 3 catches for 48 yards with one of his non-completions being a pick-6.

Devon Witherspoon played formidably in his first career start in the NFL, making a key 4th down stop while playing tight in coverage. Witherspoon was targeted and allowed the same amount of catches as Brown did but gave up 16 more yards to total 64 in his debut. He also allowed one touchdown, something that should be improved as he gets familiar with the league.
