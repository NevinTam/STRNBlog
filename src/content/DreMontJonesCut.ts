After signing the biggest contract that John Schneider has ever given out during his tenure as the Seahawks general manager, Dre'Mont Jones was cut in the off-season before the final year of his contract. Jones signed a 3-year deal worth $51 million before the 2023 NFL regular season. In year 1, he struggled to be productive, often unable to provide consistent pressure and defend the run. In all fairness, a positional change to EDGE midway through the season due to injuries at EDGE did not help him perform to the best of his ability. In year 2, under defensive guru Mike Macdonald, Jones initially continued his struggles from the 2023 season. However, as Roy Robertson Harris was traded to the Seahawks midway through the season and was able to establish a role, it seemed, according to Mike Macdonald, that Harris was able to help Jones find a fitting role in the defense. This led to Jones having a very productive stretch during the middle of the season including being one of the Seahawks most productive defensive players.

However, even his production during this stretch of the season was not up to par with the value of this contract and later, as the season ended, his production dwindled down. During his time in Seattle his best moments were in a rotational role often as a pass rusher due to his limitations as a run-defender. Mike Macdonald seemed to be able to get good production out of him but it is now open to Dre'Mont Jones and other teams in the NFL for what position he will play going forward in the NFL. In what marks the closing of the biggest signing of John Schneider's career as the general manager for the Seattle Seahawks, there seem to be lessons to be learned in paying big money for a player at a position of need. As the Seahawks approach the 2025 NFL season with gaping holes on the offensive line, the question becomes if John Schneider will be able to use the funds saved from this contract to address the offensive line or will he throw big money at a player he is unsure of whether they will fit into the Seahawks defense.
