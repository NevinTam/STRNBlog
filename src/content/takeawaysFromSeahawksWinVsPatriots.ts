### **Geno Smith is ELITE**

Geno played up to the standard that he left off at the end of 2023. He had another signature clutch performance, capping off his 9th game-winning drive since 2023. On a day where the run game was suspect and the pass protection had issues, Geno was able to put the team on his back and throw for over 300 yards. He finished the week with a 83.1 PFF Grade and elite efficiency. Adjusting for drops, he had 89% (!) completion percentage. He has been charted to have 0 off-target throws so far through two weeks. In 2024 so far, Smith has clearly cemented himself as top QB.

### Running Game Struggles

With Starting RB Kenneth Walker out, the Seahawks had struggles in the run game. The Patriots stout run defense had their way with Charbonnet and the Seahawk’s run defense, which just averaged 2.4 YPC. Without Walker, they lacked a key explosive element that was key in their week 1 win against the Broncos. Unless the Seahawks want to depend on Geno Smith having career games each week, they will need to improve their run blocking in the coming weeks, such as against the Dolphins next Sunday.

### **DK + JSN Have Career Days**

DK Metcalf and JSN both had career games. This past Sunday was the first time two Seahawks both had 10+ catches and 100+ receiving yards. JSN had several clutch receptions while converting huge 3rd downs. This game showcased everything that JSN could do in an NFL offense, from providing Smith with a safety blanket to making tough catches in the middle of the field. Metcalf also had the lone receiving touchdown on the day, a 56 yard blown coverage. Metcalf had several other chunk plays that moved the Seahawks down the field on a day where the run game was absent.

### **Seahawks Pass Rush has Been Dealing**

The Seahawks pass rush has been one of the best units in the league through 2 games. Headlined by Boye Mafe and Leonard Williams, they have already accrued 50 pressures according to PFF and have the 3rd best pass rush win rate according to ESPN. The new scheme implemented by Macdonald has created plenty of opportunities for players to make game-changing plays, even with one of the Seahawks best pass-rushers in Uchenna Nwosu currently missing time. Watch for them to be a formidable unit as the year goes on, as they could easily wreak havoc on opposing offensive lines.

### **Run Defense has Cracks**

For the first time, we saw cracks in the run defense for the Seahawks. Something that was also characteristic in Mike Macdonald’s defense last season was a struggling run defense down the stretch, and we saw more evidence of that this week. While a few of the runs could be attributed to explosives, at the end of the day the patriots were able to run for over 180 yards at 5.1 YPC with the dual tandem of Rhamondre Stevenson and Antonio Gibson. With the Seahawks next week opponents being the Dolphins with the elusive Devon Achane, they must look to tighten their run defense in the coming weeks.


### **Secondary Played Near-Flawless**

The secondary only allowed 19 (!) yards to Patriots wide receivers this Sunday. Witherspoon, Woolen, and Brown have played phenomenal this season so far, playing lockdown coverage on the Patriots and Broncos receivers. Julian Love, while giving up a touchdown in coverage, was able to help erase Hunter Henry in the second half of the game, making New England completely one-dimensional. If the Seahawks can do the same to a Skylar Thompson-led Dolphins, they are in great shape to be 3-0 heading into MNF vs the Lions.
