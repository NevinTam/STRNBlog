***Tyree Wilson: EDGE (4-3 DE)***

***Texas Tech - 6'6 - 275 LB***

Games watched: vs NC State (2022), Kansas State (2022)



Grading Scale:  

![](https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/671495d5-2d86-4880-b955-873e4699da84_877x640.png)

Tyree Wilson Grade:  

![](https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/e9b7f13c-b727-40ba-87af-96429058b826_722x344.png)

Strengths:

-Wilson consistently turns his speed into power when bull-rushing OTs.

-He has the frame (35+ inch arms) and athleticism to be versatile in his scheme fit. Wilson can play standing/hands-in-dirt along with dropping back

Shortcomings:

-Wilson's biggest letdown is his run defense. While he is able to hold the edge, Wilson is often unable to get off his block and make a play on the RB.

-Compared to guys like Will Anderson Jr and Myles Murphy, Wilson lacks elite flexibility when turning the edge on his rush.

Summary:

Tyree Wilson is one of the 3 edge rushers vying for a place within the top 5 picks in this year's draft. When you look at his measurables, he looks the part of a top 5 pick. WIlson is 6'6 and 275 pounds with 35.5 inch arms. Scouts will see similarities in his frame with last year's first round pick Travon Walker. Wilson does not lack athleticism either. He has good burst off the edge, with solid bend and the ability to drop back into coverage when necessary. In terms of flaws he still has a ways to go as a run defender, and his current pass rush is lacking polish. Nevertheless, teams should be feeling confident that they are getting a great talent in Wilson.

**Numerical Grade: 84/100**

**Projection: Floor - Quality Starter -----\> Ceiling - High-end Starter**

**Round Grade: 1st round**

**Devon Witherspoon's Scouting Report:**

***Devon Witherspoon: CB***

***Illinois - 6'0 - 180 LB***

Games watched: vs Minnesota (2022), Wyoming (2022)



Grading Scale:  

![](https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/671495d5-2d86-4880-b955-873e4699da84_877x640.png)

Devon Witherspoon Grade:  

![](https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/0831e3d7-dba3-4bca-96c6-0a12f6fa8429_810x332.png)

Strengths:

-Even with his smaller frame, Witherspoon still has the traits to be a solid press corner. He shows quick footwork; the ability to stay in phase; and nice physicality

-Excellent when playing off the line. He has elite read-and-react ability, allowing him to quickly diagnose run plays or recognize routes and break on them

Shortcomings:

-His lack of great length and smaller frame are probably holding him back a bit

-Some of the technical aspects of his game need to be cleaned up. Specifically his transition footwork, press technique; jam strength; biting too quickly on routes

Summary:

Devon Witherspoon is one of the many players in the race to be the first corner taken in the 2023 NFL draft. He has all the athletic traits of a top corner, including fluid hips and great lateral agility. His frame won't be the best in this class, but he makes that up by playing an extremely physical game. He's a solid run defender who can line up on the outside and in the slot, while being adept at both man and zone coverages. His speed will be more than enough to stick with most WRs, and his ball skills at the catch point are as solid as they come. When draft day rolls around, don't be surprised if you see Devon Witherspoon as the first corner off the board.

**Numerical Grade: 85/100**

**Projection: Floor - Quality Starter -----\> Ceiling - High-Quality Starter**

**Round Grade: Top 15**

**Zay Flowers' Scouting Report:**

***Zay Flowers: WR***

***Boston College - 5'9 - 182 LB***

Games watched: vs Clemson (2022), vs Wake Forest (2022)



Grading Scale:  

![](https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/671495d5-2d86-4880-b955-873e4699da84_877x640.png)

Zay Flowers Grade:  

![](https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/383ee19a-974b-4d50-a5cc-c2cfa1dd7f2b_668x342.png)


Strengths:

-Route running: Showed good understanding of route pacing and zone spacing; Did things to sell his routes; good footwork; good route variety

-Extremely twitchy; consistently makes guys miss in RAC

-Flowers is a very fluid athlete who is able to get in and out of his breaks without losing speed.

Shortcomings:

-Smaller frame may limit his ability to play outside as well as his catch radius

-I'd like to see him be sharper with some of his tighter cuts instead of rounding them out

Summary:

Zay Flowers brings a great skillset to teams looking for an explosive playmaker in the passing game. Flowers is a refined route runner who can also be utilized on screen passes and jet sweeps to deadly efficiency. His only limiting factor is his smaller size, but Flowers will still be able to play on the outside due to his blazing vertical speed. Expect Flowers to be one of the wide receivers off the board in the latter half of the first round.

**Numerical Grade: 83/100**

**Projection: Floor - Quality Starter -----\> Ceiling - Perennial All-Pro**

**Round Grade: 1st round**
