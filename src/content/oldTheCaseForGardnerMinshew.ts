In the final part of our series on who should be the Seahawks QB, we will be looking to see if they should acquire current Eagles backup QB Gardner Minshew, who is a figure that the NFL community has a varying opinion on. In this article, we will dive into the pros and cons of a Minshew trade.

**Played Decent Under Unfavorable Circumstances**

It's hard to succeed playing on the Jaguars but Minshew somehow found a way. While he may not have been able to carry the team to glorified wins, he was able to put up good stats knowing the team he had around him. Minshew was on the JAX team for 2 years in which he put up 6027 yards over that time, including passing and rushing. If you get him with a young-potential filled offensive line he might have a run game that would be able to support his passing abilities. The Seahawks have both a good run game, in Rashaad Penny, Kenneth Walker, and perhaps Chris Carson, and a good offensive line geared towards zone-based runs. When Minshew decides to pass it he will have significant improvements (no offense to Dede Westbrook and DJ Chark) with DK Metcalf, Tyler Lockett, D'Wayne Eskridge, Noah Fant, Will Dissly, Marquise Goodwin, and any pass-catching running backs. If he were to be traded he would be able to play at a much higher level with the immense support around him and bring a tear to the eyes of fans as they watch the former Washington Cougar excel.

**Ideal Pete Carroll QB**

While people may see the average talent Minshew has displayed on the field, he was excellent at keeping the ball in his team's hands. In his 2 years in JAX, he had an extremely slim 1.4% INT%, meaning out of all the times he threw the ball only 1.4% of the times it ended up with the opposition. For reference quarterbacks like Tom Brady, Russell Wilson, and Patrick Mahomes in the last 2 years have had INT% of 1.8%, 1.9%, and 1.5%, respectively, all higher than Minshew. Pete Carroll has repeatedly emphasized the need to have a QB who doesn't commit turnovers. Just 2 years ago in one game, Wilson had committed 4 turnovers, all of which ended up in the Bills defender's hands. Pete Carroll strives to obtain someone who doesn't turn over the ball and can hand off the ball often but pass when needed and Minshew certainly fits the bill. Gardner Minshew is the ideal Pete Carroll QB who can stray away from turnovers while supporting his run game whenever needed by passing the ball when suitable.

**Cons**

**Was Unable to Convince Jaguars he was a Viable #1 Option**

While Minshew was able to put up decent stats when with the Jaguars, he was unable to truly make a difference on the Jaguars. Many of his weaknesses come from a physical perspective, such as a lack of athleticism and below-average arm strength, which are often expected for a franchise QB to have. These weaknesses in the physical traits of his game made Trevor Lawrence a much more viable QB with more upside as a potential franchise QB, and raised questions among the league if Minshew could really "be that guy".

**Backup entire last year**

However, Eagles GM Howie Roseman took a chance on Minshew and traded for him, giving up a conditional 6th-round pick. While in Philly, he was able to become QB2 but never truly unseat Jalen Hurts as QB1 even through some of Hurts's rough games. After a full season of minimal playing, it is impossible to see how Minshew has progressed and even if it's worth taking a shot on him over other QBs on the roster such as Geno Smith and Drew Lock.

In conclusion, Minshew is a QB that could fit well with the Seahawks, as he's a QB that can manage the offense and take care of the football in a manner that Pete Caroll is looking for. He's shown these traits while on the Jaguars, a team that was in a similar situation the Seahawks are in right now but with even less talent. However, there are questions about his physical limitations along with what level of play Minshew can conjure after being relegated to a backup spot for an entire year.
