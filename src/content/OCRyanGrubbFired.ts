**What Worked**
Wide Receiver Jaxon Smith-Njigba breaking out was one of Ryan Grubb's best moments of his Seahawks OC tenure. Under former Seahawks OC Shane Waldron, Jaxon Smith-Njigba struggled mightily in getting involved in the offense. For a few weeks this season, the trend continued but halfway through the season, Smith-Njigba had an elite stretch, breaking and tying multiple franchise records. For reference, JSN tied the Seahawks single-season receptions record with 100, staying even with Tyler Lockett who has held the record since 2020. JSN also had the most consecutive games for a Seahawks WR to post 70 or more receiving yards. 

DK Metcalf also seemed to have an elite start to the year. Metcalf was in the top-5 for wide recevier receiving yards earlier this season, before his injury that held him out for nearly a month after the game against the Atlanta Falcons. Metcalf tied his receptions total from last year, totaling 66 on the season. Geno Smith broke many franchise records this year, many set by himself in 2022. He became the 20th quarterback with 70+% in a single season. He threw for 4320 yards, the most by any quarterback in Seahawks history.

Another player who seemed to have "broken out" with Ryan Grubb at the helm of the Seahawks offense was Zach Charbonnet. Charbonnet had 9 total touchdowns this year and averaged a stout 4.2 YPC behind a young and struggling offensive line. Grubb helped this team get to 10 wins, despite being handed a bad offensive line that dealt with their center retiring midway through the season; the necessity to start four right tackles, three right guards, and three centers; and the cheapest offensive line in all of football, constructed by a General Manager who believes that offensive guards are "overpaid" and "overdrafted".

**What Didn't Work**
Ryan Grubb came from a pass-heavy offense at the University of Washington with an elite offensive line and a first-round-pick in Michael Penix Jr. On the Seahawks, it felt like he often forgot that he did not have an elite offensive line anymore. Many times, the Seahawks would be left needing a few yards and Grubb would have every route run deep with no checkdown option for Geno Smith, leading to a change of possession when the team only needed a few yards. Other times in 3rd and short situations, Grubb would run the ball outside with these elaborate run-game matchups, having his tight ends block the opposing defense's best EDGE player and consequently seeing the running back get tackled behind the line of scrimmage. Grubb was also unable to use Noah Fant effectively, who signed an extension in the offseason and only had 1 touchdown on the entire season.

Kenneth Walker is an All-Pro caliber player. Under Ryan Grubb, he had career low in yards, yards per carry, and touchdowns. The current offensive line was extremely inconsistent; however, Ryan Grubb often went into halftime with his star running back only having 3 or 4 carries, representative of Grubb's willingness to immediately abandon the run whenever down on the scoreboard. 

While Geno Smith had some impressive stats this year under Grubb, Grubb also commanded an offense that had a quarterback throw 15 interceptions. While Grubb isn't solely responsible for that, he was the coordinator for the offense and this was not an issue in Geno Smith's seasons as a Seahawk prior.

**What's Next**

In what appears to be a separation due to disagreements on the philosophy of the offense, Mike Macdonald looks to find an offensive coordinator who will be able to establish the run and help a defense out that finished the season as the tenth best defense in the NFL. Ryan Grubb entered the NFL and became the Seahawks offensive coordinator after not having a single season of NFL experience under his belt. With an offense that appears ready to compete and contend in a year or two, it may need an experienced offensive coordinator. By having someone who understands that running the ball and being effective with drives can help put the Seahawks defense in great situations, this team may be close to contention. Names of experienced coaches who may be potential options for the Seahawks consist of Doug Pederson, former Super Bowl winning HC, Jake Peetz, the Seahawks current passing game coordinator who has extensive experience around the NFL, and Mike LaFleur, the offensive coordinator for the Los Angeles Rams who has rarely called plays but just called plays for a Jimmy Garoppolo who put up 334 passing yards against the Seahawks starting defense.
