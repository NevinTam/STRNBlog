There aren't many takeaways from this game that will be positive. It is hard to find positives when you lose a game 3-37.

**Offense**

Bottomline, the Seahawks scored 3 points. They had 5 penalties on the day compared to 6 first downs. The team was terrible on late downs, only converting 1 in 13 3rd and 4th downs. They had more punts than first downs converted. The Ravens held the ball more than 2 times as long as Seattle. They mustered 28 rushing yards and 123 passing yards. Nothing went well for the Seahawks against Baltimore.  

Geno Smith struggled in this game, but it was not entirely on him. The offensive line did not allow any time for Geno Smith to throw the ball as he was under duress the entire game. While he did throw a bad interception, it was said to be a miscommunication by him and Tyler Lockett after a call Geno Smith said wasn't heard by Tyler Lockett and not relayed to Lockett by slot WR Jake Bobo. The stats will only show the Seahawks offensive line only allowed 4 sacks, but the reality is Geno Smith was under pressure for more than half of his dropbacks. You cannot expect to win games in any league if you can't throw the ball and block defenders. This was the healthiest the Seahawks offensive line had been since the beginning of week 1, and they still struggled.

At one point, however, the blame cannot all be put on the offensive line, as the coaching staff, and more specifically offensive coordinator Shane Waldron, needs to realize that his protection is not holding up and adjust his game plan. We did not see any adjustments from Shane Waldron throughout the game, leaving Geno Smith out to dry for a full 60 minutes. Similarly, Shane Waldron did not have a good game plan entering this game with the routes and plays he called. There were numerous plays where all the routes were well down the field, leaving Geno Smith without a check-down option to throw to when the Ravens blitzed half their players. On other plays, the middle of the field had zero routes run when there were no defenders in the vicinity, allowing Ravens defenders to crowd around near the perimeter of the field where the Seahawks routes were being run.

The Seahawks this season have been a top-10 offense when they have 2 or 3 tight ends on the field, but this game they decided to play Jaxon Smith-Njigba much more, costing them in pass protection. JSN is a good player, but very few defenses in the NFL are equipped to defend 3 tight-end sets, so Seattle should run them more. Alas, Seattle shied away from tight end sets this game, justifying their inefficiency throughout the entire game on offense. If Seattle wants to run a good offense, tight ends will need to be part of the game plan.

**Defense**

In, perhaps, one of two bright stops for the team, Boye Mafe continued his streak of excellence, posting his 6th sack in 6 straight games. Boye Mafe is the best player for the Seahawks right now and will be until his All-Pro level play falls apart. With the absence of Uchenna Nwosu, Mafe has stepped up to the challenge, securing one EDGE spot in both defending the run and pass rush.

The other somewhat bright spot for the Seahawks was the player they added the week prior: DE Leonard Williams. Williams, while he did not record any sacks, was a dominant force for part of the game, creating push from the defensive line against one of the best offensive lines in the league. A specific play that comes to mind was where Williams pancaked Pro-Bowler Ronnie Stanley, almost getting the QB hit on Lamar Jackson who was forced to throw it to the checkdown. Williams should be a great player against weaker offenses.

For the bad aspects of the game for the Seahawks, almost everything would fit in that category. There won't be too much to dig into because nothing worked well. The Seahawks could not stop the run. The Seahawks could not stop the pass. The Seahawks could not rush the passer. The Seahawks could not make plays. The Seahawks could not stop plays. UDFA RB Keaton Mitchell was a huge reason why the Ravens almost eclipsed 300 yards rushing. The Ravens have 29 first downs and were 6/13 on 3rd conversions. They ran 75 plays because the Seahawks could not get them off the field.

For what it is worth, the Seahawks forced 2 fumbles on the Ravens and recovered both of them, but it doesn't mean anything if we can't get them off the field without a turnover. Lamar Jackson only had 5 incompletions on the day with 26 attempts, posting a near 81% completion percentage. Tyler Huntley even entered the game in garbage time and scored a touchdown. Keaton Mitchell averaged 15.3 yards per carry on 9 carries: unacceptable in the modern NFL. Lamar Jackson also had 60 yards rushing on just 10 carries as the Seahawks were unable to contain him. If the Seahawks want to justify their status as a contender and reclaim it, they need to win the next few games and iron out all their mistakes.
