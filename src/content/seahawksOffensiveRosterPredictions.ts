**Total Players: 25**

?

**QB: 2**

***Geno Smith*** is this team's starting QB and should return to practice this week. Clear roster lock. Likewise, ***Sam Howell*** , despite his struggles, is a roster lock. ***PJ Walker*** has pushed for the starting job, but with Howell being as young as many rookie QBs from the 2024 NFL Draft, it's clear Howell's value comes in the long run.

Safe: Smith, Howell

?

**RB: 4**

***Ken Walker*** will remain the starting RB for the Seahawks and is primed for a breakout season if the Offensive Line holds. ***Zach Charbonnet*** , second-round rookie from 2023, will stay as Walker's backup this season, but should still remain involved. ***Kenny McIntosh*** has not had his name thrown out all that much during training camp, but with it being his 2nd year on the team, can be a backup that will provide value on special teams. ***George Holani*** has earned some praise during training camp and seems to be leading the competition for RB4 behind McIntosh, but there could be a chance that the Seahawks only hold three running backs on the roster this season with no clear-cut 4th back. ***Kobe Lewis*** has earned some praise as well, but Holani seems to be getting the most attention.

Safe: K9, Charb, McIntosh, Holani

?

**WR: 6**

***DK Metcalf*** has looked the best he ever has during this 2024 training camp, and 1300+ yards on an offense like this with a plethora of weapons could be easily obtainable. ***Tyler Lockett*** has still looked like Tyler Lockett throughout training camp, and even though he may regress to the 3rd receiving option on the team, expecting \~800 yards from him seems likely. ***Jaxon Smith-Njigba*** will most likely be the one to replace Lockett as WR2 based on his stellar training camp. ***Jake Bobo*** as a fan favorite also has the most reliable hands on the team according to many, and could be an elite redzone option based on the plays he has made during training camp. ***Laviska Shenault Jr.*** hasn't had too much buzz around his name but in a deep WR room, having a two-time former 600 yard receiver as the 5th option swhould be something Seattle looks to do. ***D'Wayne Eskridge*** is having a good camp and probably remains on the roster due to the draft capital investment, his ability to be a returner on special teams, and perhaps untapped potential. ***Dareke Young*** was initially on this list, but having a 4th RB in Holani on the roster may make more sense than having a 7th wide receiver. ***Hayden Hatten*** has also received some buzz, but in an extremely deep recevier room, there may not be any room for the rookie UDFA. ***Easop Winston Jr.*** has had some nice days but an extremely deep room may prevent him from remaining on the roster.

Safe: Metcalf, Lockett, Smith-Njigba, Bobo, Shenault, Eskridge

**TE: 3**

Coming from the ***Russell Wilson*** trade, ***Noah Fant*** has yet to live up to first round expectations in Seattle. After recording a career low in receptions, yards, and touchdowns (0), Fant is primed for a breakout year after resigning with the Seahawks. While they do have a lot of versatility with their receivers, Fant has gone under the radar as a Seahawks pass catcher and should get close to the \~550 mark this season. ***Pharoah Brown*** signed with the Seahawks this offseason, known for his stellar blocking skills. While his roster spot isn't guaranteed, he seems like he'll make the team and the team's 2nd TE. Rookie ***AJ Barner*** hasn't received too much attention this offseason, but should provide a nice complement to Seattle's veteran tight ends.

Safe: Fant, Brown, Barner

#### **Offensive Line**

**OT: 2**

**OG: 2**

**OC: 2**

**OG: 2**

**OT: 2**

The Seahawks offensive line does not currently have clear-cut starters. Left tackle ***Charles Cross*** has been the team's best offensive linemen thus far in the offseason, and looks to be a breakout candidate. ***Laken Tomlinson*** was signed this offseason and has been extremely durable in his career, but there are questions if he will provide enough support for young Interior Offensive Line. Regardless, he is a lock to make the roster.

Center ***Olu Oluwatimi*** was hoped to take over the starting center job this offseason, but the Seahawks interest in ***Connor Williams*** may keep Olu on the bench as a startable backup. ***Nick Harris*** will challenge for Olu for the starting job, but can be a decent 2nd center if needed.

Perhaps the most unclear spot, right guard has 2nd year player ***Anthony Bradford*** with the starting job right now, rookie ***Christian Haynes*** who has not been able to cement himself as the starter yet, and ***McClendon Curtis*** who has impressed the Seahawks and played at right guard earlier in the offseaosn, but with the uncertainty of ***Abraham Lucas***, switched to right tackle.

Right tackle being the deepest spot for the Seahawks, Abe Lucas and ***George Fant*** are the clear options there. With ***Mike Jerrell*** impressing during camp, he seems like a lock to make the roster with his ability to play tackle and guard. Curtis makes the roster over ***Sataoa Laumea*** who has received very little attention this camp, while Curtis has played well and can be played at both guard and tackle.
