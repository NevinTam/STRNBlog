The Rams have struggled with keeping their star wide receivers healthy in recent weeks. Their receiving corps is headlined by Tutu Atwell and Brandon Powell. Atwell was the wide receiver taken after Dee Eskridge in the 2021 NFL draft, and has been better than Eskridge, but still a disappointment. The Rams seem to have found a minor spark of life in Cam Akers, who was questioning his place on the team for the majority of the season. Tariq Woolen and Michael Jackson have been above-average to elite corners during this year with a sub-55 % completion percentage allowed for the tandem. Van Jefferson will also be a starting wide receiver but is mostly used on go routes and deep balls, which shouldn't be a problem with Tariq Woolen's blazing 4.2 speed. If Coby Bryant is on the field in a nickel package he shouldn't be faced with a problem against Tyler Higbee, which more than likely will be covered by an LB, and will instead be in coverage against any RB/ slot WR.

**Seahawks Run Game vs Rams Front-7**

Kenneth Walker has taken a turn for the better in recent weeks, choosing to attack the open gap, rather than bend it outside in the hope of a highlight run. This has taken the Seahawks' run game to new heights, which has resulted in back-to-back Walker games with more than 100 yards. Also, last week DeeJay Dallas almost amassed 100 net yards, providing an alternative edge to a Seahawks run game that had lacked in the weeks prior. The Rams front-7 has struggled throughout this year without their key cog in Aaron Donald. Leonard Floyd has taken a large step back, most likely due to the lack of Donald, which has made himself and other EDGEs get doubled more than usual. Walker will need to have a big game to have a chance at the playoffs, and also have a chance for the OROY award if he reaches 1000 yards rushing and 10 TDs in this game or 1200 yards from scrimmage.

**Rams CBs vs Seahawks WRs**

Jalen Ramsey was the best cornerback in the league for the last few years. This year, everything changed after Ramsey had been continuously beaten deep. While Ramsey struggled a lot for a former #1 CB in the early weeks of the year, he has taken a turn recently and been much tighter in coverage. In their last matchup, DK Metcalf and Tyler Lockett both put up 100 yards receiving in what was their best showing as a duo this season. Troy Hill is the other starting cornerback for the Los Angeles Rams. Expect Hill who is 5 feet 11 inches to line up on Tyler Lockett, while Jalen Ramsey shadows DK Metcalf for the majority of the game. Expect Bobby Wagner to be in coverage on the Seahawks slot WR/TE, who should have an easy matchup against any other Seattle WR, but a difficult one against Noah Fant and Colby Parkinson.

**Rams Offensive Tackles vs Uchenna Nwosu and Darrell Taylor**

The Rams watched Andrew Whitworth retire in the offseason and head to the broadcasting industry after winning their long-awaited super bowl ring. They replaced him with backup Joseph Noteboom, but due to an injury, Noteboom has been out in recent weeks. Now Ty Nsehke, a 37-year-old tackle, will take over the left tackle spot for this game. Rob Havenstein has anchored the right tackle spot for the season. Darrell Taylor has been on an elite run in the last few weeks, posting 5.5 sacks in the last 5 games alone with 2.5 coming against the week 17 matchup against the Jets. Nwosu has been quiet on the sack front but has posted a consistent display of pressure. Uchenna has not recorded a sack in 4 straight games. Both EDGE's have a chance to reach 10 sacks each on the season. If Taylor can continue his monster finish to the season by getting 1.5 more sacks, the front office will enter the 2023 season with an impressive young EDGE duo, and hope for Boye Mafe's pass rush development.
