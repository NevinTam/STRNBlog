**Seahawks OL vs Patriots DL**
‎ 
The Seahawks had pass-protection problems with their offensive line for the last 2 years, especially last year where they ranked bottom 3 by most. After hiring Ryan Grubb as offensive coordinator and Scott Huff as offensive line coach, the plan was they would be able to get the pass protection of the offensive line to near league average and give Geno Smith a chance to be a top 5-7 QB. After what happened in the 1st half on Sunday, it looked like they got worse: a lot worse. The Patriots had a surprising win against Joe Burrow and the Bengals and had relentless pressure against the Bengals offensive line. 

If Seattle plays like they did in the first half on offense against a strong Patriots defensive line, they will drop to 1-1. If they played like how they played in the 2nd half by establishing the run and then using the run to open up the passing game, they have a good chance to win the game. This matchup is probably one of the 2 most important this game with Charles Cross looking like a franchise tackle, Laken Tomlinson strugging immensely, Connor Williams having a slow start but looking good for the rest of the game, and Abe Lucas being out and George Fant being doubtful.

**Seahawks DL vs Patriots OL**
‎ 
Like the counterpart matchup on the other side of the ball, this matchup could also sway the game for one team. The Seahawks defensive line was elite by almost all sources in week 1, posting 29 pressures according to PFF (#2 in the NFL) and 15 pressures with Pro Football Reference (#2 in the NFL). Derick Hall, Boye Mafe, and Leonard Williams each had 4 pressures according to PFR: which usually is not very leniant in allocating pressures and with what constitutes as a pressure. Byron Murphy II getting doubled team in his NFL debut shows how impressive he is, and how that will allow for other Seahawks DL to win their one-on-one's.

The Patriots' current OL is not at its strongest. OG Cole Strange has been out. OG Sidy Sow who is Strange's backup has also been ruled out. OG Layden Robinson who is the expected starter at right guard is questionable for the week 2 matchup. If Robinson does not suit up for this week to play, Nick Leverett and Zach Thomas would be in line to start. Leverett has not played a snap since the 2022 season and Thomas has played 36 snaps in his career (drafted in 2022). This Patriots offensive line gave up pressures on ~44% of dropbacks in week 1, 2nd in the NFL only behind the Broncos OL who faced the Seahawks DL. If the Seahawks DL can maintain or build on their performance from last week, they could very well shift the game for the Seahawks against a Patriots OL struggling to keep their starters.

**Patriots CBs vs Seahawks WRs**
‎ 
At face value, WRs DK Metcalf, Tyler Lockett, JSN, and Jake Bobo (Team Captain this week) should be able to beat down a Patriots secondary that has S Kyle Dugger as questionable to play, Christian Gonzales, and Jonathan Jones. While Gonzales and Jones are very good corners, Seattle's WRs probably win this matchup most of the time. However, wide receiver play is often dependent on a few things; one being the performance of the offensive line. If the OL performs as they did in week 1 last week, the Seahawks WRs are going to perform similarly. 

In the 1st half of week 1, OC Grubb had a lot of deep plays for Metcalf and JSN to capitalize on the talent they have in the WR room, but if the offensive line does not hold up like they did for most of week 1, routes will become shorter to allow Geno to get the ball out more quickly. All 4 of Seahawks WRs can go deep, but unless the offensive line holds up, their routes will be shorter and more predictable to Patriots CBs who will be able to defend them most easily with a strong pass rush and closer to the Line of Scrimmage.
