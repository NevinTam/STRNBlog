Wide Receiver Tyler Lockett's tenure with the Seattle Seahawks comes to a close after a decade with the team. Lockett, the 2nd-most productive wide receiver in franchise history behind only Steve Largent, cements himself as a legend on and off the field for Seattle. Still a reliable target at age 32, Lockett has made it clear that he has no plans to retire and should be looking for a place that he can try and win a Super Bowl Ring. Lockett earned three All-Pros as a kicker returner, of which 1 was a first team All-Pro award. Of players with 5250+ receiving yards and 45+ touchdowns from 2018-2022, Tyler Lockett is one of the 5, up there with other elite players (Travis Kelce, Tyreek Hill, Davante Adams, and Mike Evans). It is safe to say, while Lockett may have not been fully appreciated by the rest of the NFL, the people in Seattle recognize his greatness. Lockett, for his work in Seattle, was nominated for the Walter Payton NFL Man of the Year award multiple times by the Seahawks. This stemmed from his work with the Tulsa Day Center and youth sports initiatives. Known for his elite "toe-tap" catches, Lockett was one of the most reliable receivers the NFL has ever seen. He always seemed to be open and if the ball was catchable, he caught it.

After the Seahawks drafted Jaxon Smith-Njigba in the first round of the 2023 NFL Draft, it appeared that Lockett's time in Seattle may soon come to an end. However, Lockett stepped up to the challenge and put up 79 receptions in what was supposed to be one of his final years in Seattle. Even in 2024, when he was clearly chosen to be the Seahawks wide receiver 3, he put up 600 yards. As a wide receiver 2 or 3, Lockett still provides great value but his days of being a wide receiver 1 in the NFL may be over. The overarching reason for why the Seahawks released Lockett is that the price to keep him was too great for the role he was expected to have on the team. He was expected to makae $30 million in 2025, of which the Seahawks now save $17 million with the release. 
    
    "I always will be a Seahawk through and through."

With this release and the 4 earlier releases of Dre'Mont Jones, Roy Robertson-Harris, Rayshawn Jenkins, and George Fant, the Seahawks have enough money to spend and acquire talent in free agency.
