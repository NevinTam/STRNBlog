**QB Geno Smith**  
Thanks for reading SeahawksToday! Subscribe for free to receive new posts and support my work.  

Geno Smith was the Seahawks biggest offseason move this year when they resigned him to a 3 year, 105 million dollar deal, most of which was in performance escalators and incentives. In this nature, the contract allows the Seahawks to move on from Smith after 1 year if his play is not sufficient. Smith is coming off the best season of his career where he threw for over 30 touchdowns, 4000 yards, and over 100 passer rating, becoming one of the most efficient passers in the NFL last year. With the Seahawks this year, Smith is expected to be able to return to form and help the Seahawks return to the playoffs and possibly even further with new additions on offense.

**C Evan Brown**

Evan Brown has been an intriguing player for the Lions for the past 2 years. Having split 24 games equally at Guard and Center Brown provides an interesting aspect to a Seahawks team that has a need at both spots. But, Brown played as an above-average center and a below-average guard so we can expect him to secure the center spot for us during the 2023 season. Furthermore, John Schneider even acknowledged Brown's versatility but said on a podcast appearance Brown will be a center for us.   

His contract was ultimately a 1-year deal worth up to $2.25 million. To get an above-average center after having a season of terrible center play for slightly more than the veteran minimum, who is only 26 years old and will get better, is a steal of a contract for a player that allows us to not reach on a center in the draft if we choose to add competition to the spot. Nonetheless, Brown can lock down the position for us and allow us to go for the best player available in the draft because we don't have the need to pounce on a center early on to plug a nonexistent hole.

**RG Phil Haynes**

Phil Haynes split time with Gabe Jackson at RG and played left guard for Damien Lewis when needed. Haynes has been wildly inconsistent this last year as he has at times looked far better than aging veteran Jackson, and other times looks to be benched immediately. The hope is with the full-time starting job Haynes will be able to showcase his potential and be a quality starter for the Seahawks.

Before free agency officially allowed players to sign with other teams, the Seahawks resigned Phil Haynes to a 1 year, $4 million contract after reportedly wanting to get "their guy" back after seeing the weak guard free agency class. The contract itself was not bad entering free agency, but the team badly misread the market as elite guards like Isaac Seumalo signed only for 8 million per year, compared to Haynes who is by far the worse guard signing for half of that. If the Seahawks waited for the market out they could have pooled a little extra money to get an elite guard amidst a young offensive line. If the market hadn't fallen the Haynes contract would have been justified but because the market did and they missed out on better talent the Seahawks will hope Haynes can justify his contract as the starter for the Seahawks at Right Guard.

**DL Jarran Reed**

Former Seahawk Jarran Reed is resigning with the Seahawks on 2-year 10 million deal after spending 2 years with the Packers and Chiefs. Before leaving the Seahawks, Reed played well on the interior, totaling over 20 sacks and 130 pressures since being drafted by the Seahawks in 2016. However, after leaving the Seahawks, Reed has struggled to find the same success with the Packers and Chiefs, often being moved in the run game against opposing offensive linemen. While he offers good qualities in the pass rushing game, look for the Seahawks to continue to upgrade the defensive line in the draft and later stages of free agency and move Reed as a more rotational interior pass rusher, like how Quinton Jefferson was used this past season.

If Reed does not pan out, the deal has low guarantees which will allow the Seahawks to get out of the deal next year if they opt to. This would give more opportunity to younger tackles like Myles Adams or any other tackles the Seahawks have on the roster that could compete.

**DL Dre'Mont Jones**

Jones, the Seahawk's massive offseason deal, signed a 3-year, $54 million dollar deal that marked the biggest free agent deal John Schnieder has given in his 13-year tenure as the Seahawk's general manager. Jones was drafted in the 3rd round of the 2019 draft to the Denver Broncos, who he played his rookie contract out and developed into a great interior pass-rusher while being stout against the run on the inside. Jones fills a massive need on the inside after the entire rehaul of the Seahawks defensive line, which ended with the releases of Quinton Jefferson, Shelby Harris, and Al Woods. Jones is a welcome addition to a front that has struggled against the run and especially rushing the passer, as the Seahawks interior pass rush was extremely inconsistent and had issues fully bringing down the quarterback often times during the season. At only 26, Jones has a massive amount of potential after recording at least 5.5 sacks in each of the past 3 seasons with Denver, and is a great scheme fit within the Seahawks 3-4 defense, as he is coming from a similar scheme.





**MLB Devin Bush**

Devin Bush has been known as a first-round bust his entire career except for year 1. In his rookie year, he played explosively with lightning-fast speed and was able to play in coverage and defend the run at a high level. Since tearing his ACL Bush has slowly been recovering to his former self, but has been unable to reach that form. The hope is with a new environment and more time to recover Bush can anchor down one of the starting MLB positions at least until Brooks is able to take the starting job back.

Bush signed a small 1-year deal worth $3.5 million with the Seattle Seahawks. Signing Bush could be a steal of a contract if he emerges to the potential he had as a first-round draft pick, but if not the Seahawks could look to the draft to get that coverage MLB to replace Bush. However, if Devin Bush can look to emulate his rookie year abilities, the Seahawks might have found the steal of the free agency within a simple 1 deal with minimum monetary value.

**MLB Bobby Wagner**

The former Seahawks Hall of Fame linebacker Bobby Wagner is resigning with the Seahawks on a 1-year, 7 million dollar deal. Wagner had one of his best years last season with the Rams where he totaled over 6 sacks and 2 interceptions playing alongside LB Ernest Jones. In LA, Wagner played in a more simplified scheme that allowed to him to work to his strengths as a blitzer and stuffing the run, something he is still elite at and something the Seahawks need after having a porous run defense. However, this will put more pressure on the Seahawks other linebacker - whether it be Jordyn Brooks or a rookie at the beginning of the year - to excel in their role in coverage. Overall, this deal is good to ring back one of the greatest players in franchise while plugging a massive need short term, allowing the Seahawks to look for future replacements in the draft.

**S Julian Love**

Julian Love is one of the best and more versatile safeties in the league, and only just turning 25; the sky is the limit for Julian. Julian Love has been an above-average starter at safety, nickel cornerback, and a sub-LB in certain packages. Love could be the steal of the free agency for the Seahawks if he performs as a top-tier player and they extend him to make him a Seahawk for life. While the positional need is not there in signing Love as Jamal Adams and Ryan Neal are the main 2 players at the position, Love provides insurance for them as well as can play nickel to allow Neal and Adams to thrive in the roles they perform in best.

Love signed a cheap 2-year deal valued at $12 million. The safety market was another market that collapsed as the only signing of a major player worth their value was Jessie Bates who took a 4-year deal worth $64 million. Other above-average players such as Chauncey Gardner-Johnson had to take a limited-value deal in hopes to perform as an elite player to earn a big payday next season. Love also fell in a similar boat as he may have commanded upwards of $10 million if the market had not collapsed, but because the market did Seattle chose to spend even more on their safety room to acquire an emerging stud in the DB room. The Seahawks are paying Diggs, Adams, Neal, and Love all starter money so it is expected Love will play if an injury occurs to Adams or Neal and will otherwise play in his many other non-traditional safety roles or play in a traditional safety role and allow Adams to play as an LB which majorly gears towards his strengths. The Seahawks coaching staff is figured to have found a base package that features all 4 of their safeties in a way that adheres to their unique strengths to better capitalize on the value each one of them brings and justify having the safety position commanding an untraditional amount of their cap space.
