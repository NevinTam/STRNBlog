The Seahawks fall to 3-2 against the Giants last Sunday, in a game where they looked utterly outclassed in multiple phases of the game. In a game that looked eerily familiar to the style of play that got many fired last season, there were many takeaways from what was a disappointing loss. Read below for our takeaways!

**Geno and Offense Sputters**

The Seahawks offense faltered after a huge game last Monday against the Lions. The protection was not great, as Geno took 7 sacks while fighting for his life beyond the Seahawk’s offensive line. He was the top rusher for the ‘Hawks on a day where K9 and Charbonnet only received 7 carries all game. The offense was consistently in 3rd and long situations, leading to minimal scoring opportunities. Outside of some Geno heroics on the potential game-winning drive, the Seahawks offense was mostly inept due to key issues with the offensive line, a DK Metcalf fumble, and a hampered rushing attack. If the Seahawks are to improve on the offensive side, they cannot play that badly upfront, otherwise there’s almost no chance that they can play winning football that way.

**Defensive Struggles**

Even with a huge 99 yard touchdown at the beginning of the game by Rayshawn Jenkins, the Seahawks defense couldn’t rally at all towards the ball during this game. They allowed 175 rushing yards to the Giants offense and gave Daniel Jones a signature game where he had multiple touchdowns and an efficient game overall. The linebackers in this game looked lost completely, allowing for (stop me if you’ve heard this again) the Giants to continuously motor down the field slowly, hurting the time of possession. WR Darius Slayton also had a huge game, mostly on one drive where he was able to consistently beat CB Tre Brown for a long pass and a 30 yard touchdown. While the Seahawks were able to get some pressure, it was not enough to throw Jones off, allowing him to excel against what was previously a top 10 defense statistically.
