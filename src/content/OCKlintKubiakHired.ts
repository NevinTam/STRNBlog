**Background**

Kubiak is the son of NFL-coaching legend Gary Kubiak. At a young 38 years old, Klint has grown up around football his entire life. Having been in the NFL as a coach in every year except 2015 since 2013, Kubiak has worked under a variety of coaches including NFC-West rival Kyle Shanahan and Seahawks Assistant Head Coach Leslie Frazier. Leading the Vikings offense as the offensive coordinator in 2021, the Vikings ended with an above-average offense being 14th in total points. As the Saints offensive coordinator in 2024, the Saints got off to an elite start with 91 points in the first two games combined. From that point on, the Saints lost 7 straight games. However, it should be mentioned that the Saints offense suffered major injuries throughout the season, including to their quarterback, top runningback, tight end and quarterback do-it-all Taysom Hill, and their top two wide receivers in Chris Olave and Marquez Valdez-Scantling. Their star center Erik McCoy was also on IR for 7 weeks in two different stints. Still, the Saints offense ended at a respectable 24th in points and perhaps more appealing to the Seahawks, 14th in rushing yards.

**Potential in Seattle**

Kubiak will have a plethora of offensive talent to work with in Seattle. He will also have a head coach that seems to be completely aligned on the ideology that they have for the Seahawks offense. With the likes of DK Metcalf and Jaxon Smith-Njigba being at wide receiver and a versatile backfield with Ken Walker and Zach Charbonnet, it feels there is room for multiple breakouts. With that being said, perhaps differing from his predecessors, Kubiak has stressed the importance of a strong offensive line. He joins HC Mike Macdonald and GM John Schneider this offseason with that same valuation. Kubiak understands the talent has has on the team but also recognizes the weaknesses at offensive line, which feels different than the Seahawks prior OCs who were not able to adapt or coach up the offensive line well-enough. With Kubiak being expected to focus on helping find and coach up offensive line talent first, this could open up a room of possibilities for the Seahawks offense. Kubiak has also mentioned the importance of a star center, which may hint toward Seattle looking to make a big move there. Kubiak has mentioned outside zone as a focus of his scheme: something that is expected to play perfectly into Kenneth Walker's hands if the Seahawks can improve their offensive line. Like the last few off-seasons, it feels that if the Seahawks can improve their offensive line, this team can contend. Unlike prior offseasons, it feels like the offensive coordinator truly understands the importance of a good offensive line and running game, and perhaps the success of the season depends on if Seattle can acquire and improve their offensive line to avoid the pitfalls from 2024. If Seattle can find that offensive line, it appears that Kubiak is the right person for the job to help Seattle make it to the playoffs for the first time since 2022. Kubiak will look to revitalize an offense by addressing their problematic areas of the offensive line and running game.
