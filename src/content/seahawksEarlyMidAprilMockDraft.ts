**1.5: Jalen Carter DE Georgia**  
Thanks for reading SeahawksToday! Subscribe for free to receive new posts and support my work.  

As of the time writing this, Jalen Carter has visited the Seattle Seahawks in an official top-30 visit. 3-4 DE is a serious need for the Seahawks as Dre'Mont Jones should start on one side, while having Jarran Reed start on the other side may prove catastrophic. Reed played close to 40 snaps a game for teams that needed defensive line pressure, resulting in Reed being misused to the point where he was ineffective. If the Seahawks want to effectively use Reed they should have him as the third or fourth DE where he can sub in and play 15-20 snaps a game and play effectively at his age. Having Dre'Mont Jones start across from Jalen Carter while having Jarran Reed back them up could be the difference-maker in making Seattle a top 5 defense. The secondary was above-average last year, and with a playmaker like Carter, the sky is the limit for Seattle's defense.

**Trade: Seahawks send pick 1.20 to the Chiefs for 1.31 and 2.63.**

**1.31: Mazi Smith NT Michigan (Chiefs)**

The Seahawks currently have zero nose tackles on the roster who will be available to play in week 1. Bryan Mone is on the roster, but if not for his injury he may have been already cut due to his lackluster play when on the field. Al Woods was cut as a cap casualty, but in the last season, his snaps fell off as did his play due to his body aging and struggling to return from injury as fast as he did when he was younger. Poona Ford could be considered the other Seattle NT that remains off Seattle's roster because as a 3-4 DE he was out of position, but when he played nose he played like a quality starter and brought needed talent to a Seahawks' defense that had struggled against the run for the entire year. Mazi Smith could start for the Seahawks on day 1 at nose tackle, and be the clog the Seahawks have longed for in the run game with their new 3-4, while also being one of the few nose tackles that can provide pass rush upside to a team that is now focused on getting more pass rush from its defensive line.

**2.37: Adetomiwa Adebawore DE Northwestern**

As of the time writing this, Ade Ade is currently visiting the Seahawks in a top-30 visit. Ade Ade, short for Adetomiwa Adebawore, is a beast who has risen up draft boards in recent months going from the middle of the second round to the end of the first. For Seattle, he could also play as an EDGE but is a better fit for 3-4 DE due to his strength and quick agility. While we already drafted Carter in this mock, general manager John Schneider and head coach Pete Carroll have repeatedly expressed their desire to revamp the defensive line, and Ade Ade might be the perfect addition to turn their defensive line into a star-powered group. Ade plays with great speed that could provide Seattle the necessary pass-rush it needs from the 3T position to lessen double teams for its main pass rushers such as Darrell Taylor, Uchenna Nwosu, and Boye Mafe. I truly believe Ade Ade has all the potential to be a Seahawk as long as he impresses in his visit with the team.

**2.52: Josh Downs WR North Carolina**

The Seahawks need a 3rd wide receiver to complement stars Tyler Lockett and DK Metcalf and cannot wait for the potential emergence of Dee Eskridge. While Dareke Young and Cade Johnson provide intriguing options for the team's 3rd wide receiver, they only played a few snaps last year and the team does not have a large enough sample size to see if they can truly become the long desired WR3. This leads to the Seahawks drafting Josh Downs in the late second with their original pick. Downs could be exactly what the team has needed at the wide receiver position since David Moore and will allow fewer double teams on DK Metcalf and Tyler Lockett, resulting in Seattle's top two options having more opportunities to showcase their talents and furthermore prove their WR1 status. Having Downs, Metcalf, Lockett, and Fant as pass catchers while having Kenneth Walker in the backfield would be Seattle's staple offensive personnel that would be one of the best in the NFL with 4 premier pass catchers.

**2.63: Daiyan Henley LB (Chiefs) Washington State**

With the injury of Jordyn Brooks, and the former first-round pick not being expected to play in week 1, the Seahawks went and signed Devin Bush and former Seahawk Bobby Wagner to a 1-year deal. The team also lost Cody Barton who signed a cheap prove-it deal with the Commanders. Enter Daiyan Henley, the local linebacker that could be the complement to Seattle's main run stoppers. Bobby Wagner is still elite at defending the run but has fallen off in coverage, but with Seattle's new 3-4 scheme Henley could be the main linebacker who would be in coverage while Wagner could focus on defending the run. Coverage from their linebackers as well as defending the run were major problems for Seattle's linebackers in the 2022 season, but with Henley and Wagner covering both responsibilities of their jobs, opposing offenses will need to target a different part of the field to pick apart Seattle's new-look defense.

**3.83: Luke Wypler C Ohio State**

The Seahawks signed Evan Brown to a cheap 1-year deal to have him start for them during the 2023 season. With no financial ties to Brown, Seattle can afford to go after the 2nd best center in this draft and sit him for a year. Or, if Wypler wins the job in training camp he can start and Brown can be a reserve offensive lineman due to his extensive ability to play guard and center. The Seahawks had drafted Ethan Pocic in the 2nd round many years ago and let him walk in free agency. Then in the draft, they passed on Creed Humphrey for Dee Eskridge, the former being the best or second-best center in the league. While the Seahawks may be hesitant to draft a center due to their pick of Ethan Pocic they need to draft one to make sure they don't miss out on the next Creed Humphrey. Wypler can be a star for the next decade for a Seahawks' offensive line that is now filled with youth.

**4.123: Jonathan Mingo WR Ole Miss**

Jonathan Mingo is a senior receiver from Ole Miss that has improved his production each year as a starter. Mingo is a more physical receiver at 6'2 225 pounds, which he often uses to beat press-coverage and gain extra yards after the catch. Some of his weaknesses, however, include getting separation from DBs and his straight-line speed. After drafting Josh Downs earlier in this mock draft, it makes sense for Mingo to compete for the WR4 spot on the Seahawks, most likely with 2021 second-round pick Dee Eskridge. Mingo's bigger frame allows the Seahawks to use him as depth behind outside receivers Metcalf and Tyler Lockett, who have suffered some injuries in the past few years.

**5.151: Roschon Johnson RB Texas**

Backup to star RB Bijan Robinson, Roschon Johnson has still been a key contributor for the Longhorns for his collegiate career. Johnson is a running back with great vision and instincts coupled with a high short-burst speed that can get him through gaps into the open field. He is at his best with his straight-line speed but has struggled with his change of direction at times. he can be a great-third down back with his pass-blocking skills and above-average pass-catching. With the Seahawks losing RBs Rashaad Penny and Travis Homer in free-agency, the Seahawks could use Johnson as their next 3rd down back and make Deejay Dallas the primary running back behind OROY candidate Kenneth Walker.

**5.154: Zach Kuntz TE Old Dominion**

Zach Kuntz is a massive 6'8 TE and has proven to be a mismatch who was utilized all over the field for Old Dominion. He is a good route-runner with great hands that give him a massive catch radius. However, he does not offer as much as a blocker or even after the catch, making defenders miss after securing the ball. The Seahawks have 3 tight ends currently on the roster with Noah Fant, Will Dissly, and Colby Parkinson. Dissly and Parkinson have suffered several injuries in their careers thus far, giving the opportunity for the Seahawks to use Kuntz as depth who could then become TE3 next year once Parkinson's contract expires.

**6.198: Jay Ward S LSU**

Ward is a versatile safety who has had a history playing at corner before transitioning to becoming a full-time safety. He is a leader of the LSU defense and it shows in the effort he puts on the field, constantly hustling towards the ball carrier when in pursuit. He has had some issues in tackling throughout his career but is still a good player that can make impact plays. The Seahawks could use Ward as a backup safety for Quandre Diggs and Jamal Adams, as well as at slot corner for depth behind Coby Bryant or Julian Love.

**7.237: Evan Hull RB Northwestern**

Evan Hull is the 2nd RB the Seahawks will be taking and has strong abilities as a 3rd-down back, with a great receiving skill-set. He runs with power and breaks-tackles after securing the ball, making him a useful power back that the Seahawks are lacking. However, Hull is not great at pass-blocking, something he will have to improve at during his rookie year. Hull would fit into the Seahawks after they lost their previous 3rd down back in Travis Homer in free agency, and could play behind Dallas and Johnson as a rotational running ba.
