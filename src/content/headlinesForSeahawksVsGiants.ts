**Seahawks Secondary vs. Giants Receiving Corps**

The Seahawks' secondary will be at almost full strength for the first time this season with the return of Jamal Adams after a year-long rehabilitation, the return of Tariq Woolen after a prolonged chest injury, and Devon Witherspoon making his third start in a row after a long period of time away from the team with a hamstring issue. While their surprise starter at nickel, Artie Burns who has played well there, will most likely miss the game with an injury, in Jamal Adam's return Julian Love can start at nickel and be utilized more in the role that plays to his strengths in how he played in New York. The Giants are headlined at wide receiver with Jalin Hyatt, Darius Slayton, Isaiah Hodgins, and Parris Campbell, arguably the worst receiving core in the entire National Football League. Daniel Jones has also struggled throwing the ball this season with a 2-4 TD-INT ratio 3 games into the season, with 2 of those interceptions under pressure. While he has gone against difficult teams like the San Francisco 49ers, the Dallas Cowboys, and even to a certain extent to Arizona Cardinals, Seattle should also provide difficulty for him to throw the ball. With an almost fully healthy secondary for Seattle, the Giants should have no chance to have a receiver with over 100 yards and should be dominated for most of the game.

**Seahawks Rushing Defense vs. Giants Rushing Attack**

The Seahawks have dominated the opposing team's running backs, keeping the Panthers at bay with 12 rushes for 33 yards, a measly 2.75 yards per carry. Last week was not a fluke, however, as across the whole season Seattle has allowed running backs to run for 198 yards on 72 attempts for 2.75 yards per carry on the dot. The Giants have star Saquon Barkley as their lead horseback but is now listed as "doubtful" for the Monday Night Football primetime game and will most likely be sat out. Behind Barkely is Matt Breida, who ran 17 yards on 4 carries, not a strong performance. Combine 17 yards with Seattle's stout run defense after Pete Carroll fixed the scheme to his former run-stopping prowess, and Breida is most likely to go nowhere. The Seahawks' run defense should dominate this matchup in every shape and form, allowing more passing plays for the Giants and more opportunities for Seattle to rush the passer. This primetime game against the Giants should be no different than what Seattle has already done against its first 3 opponents' rushing attacks.

**Seahawks Pass Rush vs. Giants Offensive Line**

After 2 relatively dormant weeks rushing the passer, the Seahawks woke up in week 3 with an NFL-high 36 pressures against the Carolina Panthers. The group as a whole had 3 sacks on backup QB Andy Dalton. The main pass rush unit of the Seahawks, the linebackers and defensive line, had 31 pressures led by Mario Edwards Jr. who had 9. Boye Mafe has 7 and Jarran Reed 5. The Giants will be without star Left Tackle Andrew Thomas, allowing Seattle to place their best pass rushers against backup left tackle Joshua Ezeudu. While Uchenna Nwosu has disrupted the backfield through all of Seattle's first 3 games, he has yet to record a sack, but against the backup Joshua, a sack should come fairly easily. Seattle may be without Dre'Mont Jones this week who is suffering from a hip injury but in questionable nonetheless. 2022 NFL Draft top tackle Evan Neal has had a rough start to his 2023 NFL season and week 4 should be difficult as well against a Seahawks group that is looking to keep its pass rushing momentum alive. Jarran Reed and Mario Edwards shoved opposing offensive linemen back consistently, and against an undersized rookie center in John Michael-Schmitz, Reed and Edwards should have a field day. With an extremely weak offensive line and a lack of a run game and a quarterback who has struggled out of the game, Seattle should be forcing the Giants to pass a lot more, and in return, get tons of pressures and sacks and build off their NFL-best outing in week 3 to keep their pass-rush momentum alive.

**Seahawks Receiving Corps vs. Giants Secondary**

The Seahawks receiving corps should have a big day against the Giants secondary. The Giants passing defense has consistently ranked at the bottom of the league after 4 weeks, which should provide a prime opportunity for DK Metcalf, Tyler Lockett, and Jaxon Smith-Njigba to attack and pick apart this secondary. To compliment this, the Giants pass rush has not been great either on the pass rush this season, only forcing 42 pressures through 3 weeks compared to the Seahawks 62. This will only give more time for Geno to pick apart the defense. With LT Charles Cross likely out for this game as well, look to see the Seahawks to utilize more tight-end sets to hit the Giants in the short-intermediate game, something they have been doing for the past two weeks. As such though, likely do not expect much of an increase in JSN's production, as he will have less snaps as a result of this strategy.
