However, even his production during this stretch of the season was not up to par with the value of this contract and later, as the season ended, his production dwindled down. During his time in Seattle his best moments were in a rotational role often as a pass rusher due to his limitations as a run-defender. Mike Macdonald seemed to be able to get good production out of him but it is now open to Dre'Mont Jones and other teams in the NFL for what position he will play going forward in the NFL. In what marks the closing of the biggest signing of John Schneider's career as the general manager for the Seattle Seahawks, there seem to be lessons to be learned in paying big money for a player at a position of need. As the Seahawks approach the 2025 NFL season with gaping holes on the offensive line, the question becomes if John Schneider will be able to use the funds saved from this contract to address the offensive line or will he throw big money at a player he is unsure of whether they will fit into the Seahawks defense.
