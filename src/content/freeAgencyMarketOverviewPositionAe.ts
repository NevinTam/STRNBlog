**Germaine Pratt**

Germaine Pratt was drafted in the 3rd round of the 2019 draft and has been with the Bengals for the 4 seasons following, becoming a free agent for the first time this offseason. Pratt, while decent at defending the run, is mainly known as a great coverage linebacker in his prime at 26-years old, and has steadily improved each year after taking over the starting role mid-way though the 2020 season.

**Contract Estimate:**3 years $33 million

**Should the Seahawks Sign:**Germaine Pratt seems like what Cody Barton could have been, a great coverage linebacker who could also defend against the run. If the Seahawks let go of Barton, Pratt would make sense as the logical replacement who could fill the ILB role very well for years to come.

**Bobby Wagner**

Wagner, as many of you know, was drafted by the Seahawks in the second round of the 2012 draft, and played with the Seahawks for almost a decade before signing with the Rams last offseason. He was released earlier this offseason and has shown interest in signing with the Seahawks again. With the Rams, he had one of his best years in coverage and against the run, recording over 140 tackles, 2 interceptions, and a career-high 6 sacks en route to a 2nd-team All-Pro Selection.

**Contract Estimate:**2 years $24 million

**Should the Seahawks Sign:**The Seahawks should prioritize finding younger talent in free agency instead of signing Wagner for an expensive deal with the limited funds they have this year. If Wagner isn't signed in the second or third waves of free agency, it could make sense for the Seahawks to make a deal with him.

**Lavonte David**

Lavonte David, like Wagner, is a longtime veteran who has stayed with his original team, the Buccaneers, since being a second-round pick in 2012. David has been one of the better linebackers in the league throughout his career and continued to do through the 2022 season. He recorded 120 tackles and 3 sacks while playing almost every snap of the season. He could be a valuable asset to a contending team and will likely test free agency before making a final decision.

**Contract Estimate:**2 years, $27 million

**Should the Seahawks Sign:** Similar to Wagner, if the Seahawks see David present in the 2nd or 3rd waves of free agency, they might sign him for a smaller contract due to a smaller market for David.
