**History compared to 2022**

Russell Wilson has never been known for passing to his tight ends, or in fact, the middle of the field, where Tight Ends thrive in an offense.

Above is Russell Wilson's "heatmap" according to PFF, on all of his routes and targets from the 2019 season. In one of his best statistical seasons as a passer, Wilson threw for 4110 yards on 341 completions. We can see that majority of his best throws were near the perimeter of the field, while the center area was an extremely dark red, showing below-average frequencies. Statistically, Wilson's top tight end in 2019 was Jacob Hollister, who brought in 41 of Wilsons' 341 completions, along with 349 yards of the QB's total 4110 passing yards. In other words, during the 2019 season, Hollister accounted for 12% of all Wilson completions and 8.5% of the QB's total passing yards.

Turning to the present day, halfway through the 2022 NFL Season, we can compare Shane Waldron and Geno Smith to Russell Wilson. Geno Smith has no trouble putting the ball anywhere on the field. Whether it be the perimeter or the middle, you can be assured Geno Smith will get it there with accuracy. Thriving in an offense that is centralized on tight end usage, Waldron has engineered one of the best offenses this season. A large amount of that success has been because Geno knows to use his tight ends and take the short passes, something that is needed in the Shanahan scheme, which was also something that Wilson wasn't able to do consistently during his tenure in Seattle. Geno Smith has thrown 2199 yards on 207 completions through the first 9 weeks of the 2022 season. Similarly to Wilson, we will take his top tight end, even though he has 3 quality tight ends who are producing. Noah Fant, within 9 games, has accumulated 272 yards and 27 receptions, or 13% of all Geno's completions and 12.5% of the QB's total passing yards. While a similar percentage of both QBs' throws that are completed are going to their top tight end, Geno is also giving tons of target share to Dissly and Parkinson, compared to Wilson who mainly targetted his top tight end. Also, while the percentage for Geno slightly edges out Wilson, the volume is much larger because Fant is on pace for 51 receptions this year, beating out Hollister's 41 in 2019. Comparing yardage, Fant has a much higher percentage of Geno's total passing yards than Hollister. In fact, Fant is on track for 514, close to 150 yards more than Hollister and Wilson's duo in 2019.

If we take a look at the entire tight end group, rather than the top tight end, the numbers shift extraordinarily, percentage-wise, while the volume, continues to favor the 2022 tight end group. In 2019, the Seahawks had 5 total tight ends, while the currently Seahawks have 3. For fairness, we will compare stats through 9 games, and project them for 17 games for the 2022 Seahawks. During the 2019 season, the 5 tight ends combined for 861 of Wilson's 4110 passing yards, or 21% of his total passing yardage, for an average of 172 yards per each of his 5 tight ends. During the 2022 season, the 3 tight ends have currently combined for 667 of Smith's 2199 passing yards, or 30% of his total passing yardage, for an average of 222 for each of his 3 tight ends. If we scale it to predict the entire 2022 season with the remaining 8 games, we can say the 3 tight ends will account for 1260 of Geno's 4154 passing yards, or also similarly 30% of his season's passing yards, for an average of 420 yards for Parkinson, Fant, and Dissly each. If we compare the entire 2019 season to the projected 2022 season stats we can see Geno Smith is better at using his tight ends, both percentage and volume-wise, while only having 3 tight ends, compared to Wilson's 5, and each tight end on Geno's team has more value, yardage wise, than Wilson's team.

Shane Waldron has brought this offense to never-seen-before grounds, using a proficient quarterback who is able to target the short and medium game to give his uniquely skilled and talented tight ends their best chance to reach their full potential.

**Will Dissly: Unexpected Success**

Will Dissly has been a pleasant surprise for the Seahawks after many wrote him off after suffering 2 season-ending injuries in his first 2 years in the league. Many were shocked when GM John Schneider resigned him for 3 years and 24 million, putting him in the top 17 TEs in APY. Many doubted Dissly because after Dissly came back from both of his injuries in 2020, he seemed to not get the ball as much and instead was used more as a blocker instead of a true passing threat. He has proved these doubters wrong this season, however, as he has excelled with Geno in the short passing game, being instrumental in converting first downs as Smith's safety blanket. Part of this is due to Dissly high catch rate, which is currently at an extremely high 92% right now. With the new tight-end usage in this year's scheme following the Russell Wilson trade, Dissly has found an important role in the passing game while continuing to be excellent in the run-blocking game.

**Colby Parkinson Emergence**

Parkinson was the Seahawk's 4th-round pick in their 2020 draft class and was considered an athletic marvel at 6'7. Unfortunately, he suffered through a broken foot and other injuries in his rookie year and again suffered a broken foot in his second year, delaying his development. He was able to get on the field more in the last few games of the 2021 season, where he caught a total of 3 catches for 26 yards. This year has seen him properly develop with him fully healthy in the TE3 role. With the new emphasis on tight-end usage, he has had important contributions as the 6th passing option, illustrating even further how the tight-end position has been critical in the new Seahawks offense. He is on pace for over 300 receiving yards, providing key chunk plays for QB Geno Smith while playing excellently in the run game.

**Noah Fant's Breakout**

Statistically, Noah Fant is on pace for the lowest yards in his career, but that is not the main story of the former first-round draft pick. Known for his struggles in both run and pass blocking, in recent years the Broncos have used him less for those traits, compared to the early years of his career. But his struggles appeared to the Seahawks as something that could be turned around, and they made him into a strong blocker with good push in both pass and run blocks. With his unexpected improvements, Fant has turned into a quality 3-down tight end, who has emerged as the clear cut Tight End 1 in recent weeks.
