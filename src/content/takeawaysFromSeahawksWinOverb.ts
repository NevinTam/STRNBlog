**Offensive Inconsistent... Once again.**

This time, it might not have been entirely their fault. The offense was mostly kaput for the first half, save for a Jason Myers field goal. Following this, however, they were able to score on all 3(!) of their offensive posessions in the second half, mostly off the back of Geno Smith. He had a nice touchdown throw to DK Metcalf in the back of the endzone along with the game winning touchdown to Colb Parkinson. Parkinson easily boxed out his defender to pluck the ball out of the air. This is the type of play the Seahawks have been seeking from Parkinson since he was a 4th round pick in 2020.

Kenneth Walker had a quiet day but well when he was able to recieve good blocking, having several long carries including one for 24 yards late in the game.

Geno Smith, as usual, had several clutch moments, including a huge 3rd-down conversion on the game winning drive to JSN that likely saved the Seahawks season.

If the Seahawks are to continue to try and push for a wild card spot, they must maintain long drives on offense due to the state of the defense (more on that next section).

**Defensive Implosion**

While the Seahawks looked as if they kept up their defensive performance from last week, they allowed the Titans to march down the field and take up huge swaths of time on each of their posessions. In a very KNJ-2021 Seahawks esque way, they allowed constant checkdowns and even worse, got ran all over by Derrick Henry en-route to nearly choking a game away to a significantly worse team.

While the Seahawks didn't let Tannehill have a huge game against them, they allowed him to motor down the field and exploit soft zones in coverage, frequently targetting LBs Bobby Wagner and Devin Bush.

If the Seahawks are attempting to reach a playoff berth, they need to right the ship on defense, making sure they tighten up the run defense to help stop teams from running all over.
