    After trading Russell Wilson the Seahawks are left with a plethora of picks, including the 9th pick in the entire draft. Seattle has not picked this high since drafting Tackle Russell Okung 6th overall in the 2010 NFL Draft. More than a decade away the Seahawks will have multiple positions that should be addressed through the draft, one way or another. Below will have a full Seahawks Mock Draft with every pick from the Rounds 1--7.

Round 1 Pick 9 --- Charles Cross --- OT --- Mississippi State

Charles Cross is a great pass blocker for Mississippi State, mostly playing LT for them. Playing in an air-raid offense has given him plenty of prowess as a pass blocker, possibly being the best pure pass block tackle in the entire draft. He also has the potential to be a good run blocker in the NFL, despite the small sample size within college football. The Seahawks have been unable to resign tackles Duane Brown and Brandon Shell, making their tackle depth chart extremely thin. Cross could easily be a franchise left tackle while the "hidden gem" in Jake Curhan could hold down the right side. An important position filled with a star player.

Round 2 Pick 40--- Boye Mafe --- ED --- Minnesota

Seattle's pass rush has been of major concern in the last few years. While they attempted to address it last year with the additions of Kerry Hyder Jr., Carlos Dunlap, and retention of Benson Mayowa, none of those acquisitions remain on the roster. Adding Boye Mafe to a struggling pass rush would certainly be a step in the right direction in terms of addressing the problem.

Round 2 Pick 41--- Roger McCreary --- CB --- Auburn

Seattle right now lacks a clear CB1 with the departure of CB DJ Reed in the offseason. McCreary has the potential to be this CB1, and has some qualities that Pete Caroll values in DBs, despite being slightly shorter and having smaller arms. McCreary is great in the run game and has good ball skills, while being great in man coverage, something the Seahawks are looking forward to running more of next season.

Round 3 Pick 72--- Channing Tindall--- LB --- Georgia  

![](https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/0210c4d9-375d-4436-9417-ba440b7a9354_700x466.jpeg)

Tindall was a member of the stacked 2021 Georgia Bulldogs defense that eventually won the National Title, which made it hard for Tindall to receive starter reps. However, Tindall showed plenty of talent, being physical and smart in the run game while excelling as a blitzer, similar to Jordyn Brooks. In pass coverage, Tindall does have some work to do in pass coverage but is definitely a "project" player that can grow within Seattle's new system centered around aggressiveness and blitzing.

Round 4 Pick 109--- Kellen Diesch --- T --- Arizona State  

![](https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/db6b9805-905a-48dc-a80f-b04fa5751a39_700x361.jpeg)

Kellen Diesch is an offensive tackle that could be what the Seahawks are looking for in a young developmental player. Diesch is a good run blocker who can move in space quickly, and in the passing game he is refined but has issues against power rushers due to strength differences. His ability in the run game might be appealing for the Seahawks who could be looking for fast athletic offensive linemen that can effectively run offensive coordinator Shane Waldron's zone-run scheme.

Round 5 Pick 152--- Pierre Strong Jr. --- HB --- South Dakota State  

![](https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/429e4118-da26-4ae7-8889-3d087517db94_700x393.jpeg)

Pierre Strong Jr could be an important depth player at RB. Strong is more of an elusive-style RB, with good speed and body control, while also being a dynamic threat out of the back field. The Seahawks, who have often injured RBs in Chris Carson, Rashaad Penny, and Travis Homer, could use Strong's versatility as a 3rd down back to strengthen the Seahawks current RB committee.

Round 5 Pick 153--- Neil Farrell Jr. --- DI --- LSU  

![](https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/821e90ef-b2e1-4a27-8097-e3d370538b5b_700x466.jpeg)

Neil Farrell Jr is a prototypical nose tackle out of LSU at 6' 4' and 330 lbs. He is great for eating blocks and filling gaps in the run game while showing impressive strength in bull-rushes in pass-rush situations. Seattle could use a nose tackle after switching to a 3--4 defense, where they currently only have Al Woods and Bryan Mone there (Poona Ford is most likely too small for a 3-4 nose tackle but may see some snaps there from time to time).

Round 7 Pick 229 --- Slade Bolden --- WR --- Alabama  

![](https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/72569b61-7230-474c-9907-1aca962e5c92_700x394.jpeg)

Slade Bolden is a slot receiver out of Alabama who can quickly break on his routes and be ready to provide YAC as soon as the ball is in his hands. Bolden would provide depth at a position where the Seahawks have not had consistency at for a while. With Dwayne Eskridge out for an extended amount of time last season, Bolden and WR Freddie Swain would be important for the continued production from the slot in Shane Waldron's offense.

This mock draft didn't include any trades, but it is very likely that General Manager will make at least one if not more draft day trades with the new capital he was obtained. The next few days will be critical for the course of the Seahawks franchise, and as always, SeahawksToday will be present to provide you coverage on all Seahawks news regarding the draft.
