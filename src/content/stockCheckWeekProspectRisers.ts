        Well, it's that time of year again, and no I'm not talking about the holidays. College Football is back, and with it, the many names vying for attention in the 2023 NFL Draft. Everyone knows about the CJ Stroud's and Bijan Robinson's of the world, but today I'll name a few guys of the more unknown guys who have greatly improved their draft stock during week 3.

**Michael Penix Jr - QB - Washington**

If you were paying any attention to college football this past weekend, you may have heard of the unranked Washington Huskies (now ranked no. 18) upsetting no. 11 Michigan State. Being a Huskies fan myself I got a firsthand look at what Penix was able to do against the Spartans' defense. Although Penix didn't end with the greatest completion rate, going 24/40, he did throw for 397 yards and 4 touchdowns while taking care of the football. Penix showed scouts his considerable arm talent and accuracy in tight windows, and now fans could see him possibly go on day 2 of the draft if he continues to play as he does.

**Mohamed Ibrahim - RB - Minnesota**

After missing all of the 2021 season with an injury, Mohamed Ibrahim has come back with a fury, ripping the Colorado defense for 202 yards and 3 tds, while also averaging 8.8 yards per carry. Bijan Robinson and Jahmyr Gibbs may be getting all the attention right now but with the way Ibrahim is playing, he could get him up there in the early day 2 conversation. Ibrhamin has great vision and motor and would make an NFL team very happy with his ability to create big plays as an early down back.

**BJ Ojulari - EDGE - LSU**

If you were looking at early 2023 mock drafts in the preseason, you may have seen the name BJ Ojulari thrown around a few times. Ojulari is the brother of 2021 first-round pick Azeez Ojulari and possesses some of the same strengths that his brother does, being an explosive long pass rusher. Coming into the season I thought Ojulari produced some exciting but raw tape. He has strengthened his profile this season after a good showing vs Mississippi State, with 3 tackles and 1.5 sacks against a solid MSU o-line. Seahawks fans should take a closer look at Ojulari as the Seahawks have shown weakness at EDGE over the first 2 games and Ojulari would make a round 2 addition.

**Rakim Jarrett - WR - Maryland**

Behind the arm of Taulia Tagovailoa, the Terrapins have gotten off to a 3-0 start, with Rakim Jarrett being instrumental in their success. Jarrett has been a major deep threat, averaging 19.2 yards per catch over the first three weeks. While he may not be the biggest guy, he will provide a dangerous slot weapon for any team looking for a day 2 receiver in the draft.

**Garrett Williams - CB - Syracuse**

There are plenty of corners in the first-round conversation, and Garrett Williams is one of those names. Williams has been a key piece for the Syracuse defense so far, and he helped them secure a win over Purdue last week with 9 solo tackles and 2 pass breakups. William's ball skills and tackling ability paired with his great athletic ability will definitely give CB-needy NFL teams something to think about when looking at his tape.

And that's it for the week 3 risers. In future articles I will focus more on prospects Seahawks fans should be taking a closer look at, but until next time, Go Hawks!
