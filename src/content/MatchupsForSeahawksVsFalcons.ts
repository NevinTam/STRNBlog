        The Seahawks face off with the Falcons in what could be called a "tank bowl" during their week 3 matchup. Both teams have struggled during their first 2 weeks, as the Seahawks have gone 6th quarters without a single offensive point, and the Falcons manage to get into very dramatic games that in the end in heartbreaking losses for them. Today we will go through 5 key matchups that could decide who wins this game.

**1. Seahawks WRs Tyler Lockett and DK Metcalf vs Falcons CBS AJ Terell and Casey Heyward**

The Seahawks WR duo now faces another good CB duo in AJ Terell and Casey Heyward. Terell, a 2nd-team All-Pro in 2021, had elite coverage statistics, locking down receivers opposite of him. Heyward, a veteran in the league, also excelled with the Raiders last season, leading him to sign a new deal to bring him to Atlanta. However, so far, Terell has struggled in coverage so far in 2022, giving up 100 yards, 75% completion percentage, 3 touchdowns (as many as he gave all last year), and a 138 passer rating against in only 2 games. Such a decline in production from Terell, who is still a talented corner, could be taken advantage of by Metcalf, a big physical player who we have seen can dominate a game against an unprepared corner. Primed for a breakout game, Metcalf has seemed underutilized in the new scheme, only used on shorter passes with minimal deep targets (besides the one that got called back). He could get that this game as it has been told by Carole that he supports the idea of Geno slinging it downfield to Metcalf, who could take advantage of Terell's slump to have a monster game. Lockett has remained reliable even in loss, as he went over 100 yards on easy chunk completions that moved the chains. Such a performance could be required again on Sunday as many of Seattle's other receivers have been "beyond mid" and vastly underperformed. Heyward has played alright in his first 2 games, but is still a regressed version of his 2021 season through the first 2 weeks of play, as he's given up 100 yards and yielding a 60% completion percentage for a passer rating against 87.5%.

**2. Seahawks LBs Jordyn Brooks and Cody Barton** **+ Seahawks SS Josh Jones vs Falcons TE Kyle Pitts**

Kyle Pitts is the definition of a monster. He has the body of a tight end who can play like a wide receiver, which allowed him to become the first rookie TE in over 50 years to record 1000 receiving yards in a season. However, Pitts has been less of a factor in the first 2 games, only recording 4 receptions for 38 yards in 2 games. Pitts still has an immense level of talent and is primarily getting covered by Jordyn Brooks and Cody Barton, who have struggled in coverage so far. Brooks has had an overall weakness in coverage, as he gave up over 800 yards last season and close to an 80% completion percentage. This year has been on the same trend for him. Barton is also similar in this aspect, having given up an 87% completion percentage. In order to keep the Atlanta offense in check, Seattle will have to make Kyle Pitts have a quiet game otherwise the Seahawks' struggling offense will get outplayed very quickly.

**3. Seahawks Front 7 vs Falcons Rushing Attack with RB Cordarrelle Patterson**

The Seahawks have had a bad rushing defense lately, giving up a high volume of rushing yards at high efficiency to the Broncos and 49ers. The Falcons have a worse offensive line than both, on top of missing their starting LG Elijah Wilkinson. This will be a true test for the Seahawks' run defense because as their opposing offensive line is weak, they still have to go against one of the shiftiest RBs in the game in Cordarelle Patterson, who started as a kick returner and morphed into an all-around offensive weapon for the Falcons. As such, he can be utilized in many different ways, making it critical that LBs Jordyn Brooks and Cody Barton are able to stop Patterson as both a rushing and receiving threat in order to minimize the Falcons' defense.

**4. Seahawks Rushing Offense with RBs Rashaad Penny and Kenneth Walker III vs Falcons Front 7**

The Falcons Front 7 features new faces this season, now with Rashaan Evans, formerly of the Titans, and Arnold Ebiketie, a high 2nd round pick. They still have a former all-pro in Grady Jarett who can still be effective in stopping the run and pass. The Seahawks have been very ineffective in running the ball, even with great talent in the backfield with Rashaad Penny and Kenneth Walker. The Seahawks have run the ball very little, opting instead to throw shorter passes with Geno instead of utilizing this RB talent in their backfield, despite that being a promise of Pete Caroll before the season. This game will be a true test if the Seahawks want to establish the run or air the ball out more.

**5. Seahawks CBs Michael Jackson and Tariq Woolen vs Falcons WRs Drake London and Olamide Zaccheus**

The Seahawks' rookie experiment at outside corner in Tariq Woolen has so far paid dividends, as he has only allowed 3 receptions for 48 yards in 2 games along with a blocked field goal that was returned for a touchdown by Michael Jackson last week. Now he faces another physical player in top-10 pick Drake London. London has played very well in his first 2 games, recording 13 receptions for 160 yards and 1 touchdown, making the matchup of Woolen vs London a highly anticipated one as both have done their job very well. Michael Jackson has also played well through the first 2 weeks, allowing 4 receptions for 39 yards compared to Zaccheus, who has recorded 6 receptions for 70 yards in 2 weeks.



Overall, the Seahawks may have the positional edge on the Falcons, but the Falcons have big playmakers at key positions, making anything possible in today's game.
