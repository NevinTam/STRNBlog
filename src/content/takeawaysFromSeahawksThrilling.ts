**Offense Sparks at the Right Time**

The Seahawks offense at first seemed like the same it was through the 4-game losing streak, with consistent 3-and-outs and not much rhythm outside of a field-goal drive late in the second quarter. The Seahawks found themselves down 10-3 at halftime before finding success rushing the football through Ken Walker. Walker essentially had an entire touchdown drive by himself, as the Seahawks opening drive in the 3rd led them to run all over the Eagles, capped off with a 29-yard TD drive by K9 to tie the game up. The Seahawks were in position to potentially go for a touchdown later in the 4th-quarter but weren't able to convert the 3rd down, leading to a field goal to make the game 17-13, Eagles. After getting the ball back with just under 2 minutes, Drew Lock led a 92-yard TD drive with huge contributions from DK Metcalf and Jaxon Smith-Njigba, who scored the game-winning touchdown on an incredible catch.

Overall, the Seahawks found their offensive consistency - a team that can run the ball well and efficiently against one of the best rushing defenses in the league. It remains to be seen if the Seahawks will continue to do that against the Titans, one of the worst defenses in the league, once they get Geno Smith back.

**Defense Keeps them in the Game**

The Defense played very well for the most part of the game. After allowing an opening-touchdown drive to the Eagles (7th one this season), they were able to clamp down on Hurts for the rest of the half, severely limiting his passing ability and leading him to scramble often. This led them to only get 3 points during the rest of the half. The Seahawks, despite a huge lack of pass-rush, were able to limit Hurts to under 200 yards of passing and stop a dangerous Philly WR core, led by AJ Brown and Devonta Smith. After allowing a Philadelpha touchdown in the 3rd-quarter after a Tush Push, Julian Love recorded a huge interception that halted the Eagles momentum. After forcing another punt, Julian Love recorded another incredible interception, sealing the game and a Seahawks win.
