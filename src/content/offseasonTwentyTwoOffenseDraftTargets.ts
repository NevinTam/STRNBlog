    title: 'Seahawks 2022 Offseason Offensive Draft Targets',
    description: 'After a quiet free agency Seattle is forced to look towards the 2022 NFL Draft to cover any positions they feel were not adequately addressed. In Part 1 of the Positional Draft Targets, we will cover every offensive position from ones that need to be looked at immediately to ones the Seahawks can manage without drafting. Part 2 will be similar, but for defense instead.',

### QB: With QB the Seahawks are not in a very good spot. They have turnover machine Drew Lock, 25 yards passer Jacob Eason, and a 3-game starter Geno Smith under their belt. They could look towards Free Agency and sign someone or give Colin Kaepernick a chance, but their best bet is drafting one for the future. There are intriguing names in the draft for the Seahawks, such as Liberty QB Malik Willis or Cincinnati QB Desmond Ridder, among others.

## **Tier 2 Need**

### RB: The Seahawks are set at running back. With a healthy Chris Carson and Rashaad Penny, this boasts an extremely solid 1–2 punch. There happens to be good depth in DeeJay Dallas and Travis Homer but both are extremely unproven. This is also a slight concern with Penny and Carson’s injury history. They should look towards drafting one late to provide serviceable depth.

## **Tier 3 Need**

### WR: The 2022 Seattle Seahawks boast an extreme “top-heavy” wide receiver group. They hold a rising star in DK Metcalf, an extremely reliable player in Tyler Lockett as their top two starters. The Seahawks have attempted to draft depth at the position, as last year they used their second round selection on WR Dwayne Eskridge, who has high potential and is extremely explosive with the ball in his hands. The Seahawks may want to draft another one due to Eskridge’s lackluster season and the mediocre depth behind their main two.

## **Tier 3 Need**

### TE: The Seahawks recently pulled off a blockbuster trade in which as part of the deal they acquired Noah Fant, a former first-round pick with freak athletic traits. They also resigned Will Dissly to a 3-year $24 million contract. Seattle also has a monster depth piece in Colby Parkinson coming in at a height of 6' 7. They do not need to spend on their tight end group.

## **Tier 4 Need**

### LT/RT: The Seahawks in the last year had a former All-Pro tackle in Duane Brown and a solid right tackle in Brandon Shell. Fast forward a year and Duane Brown is coming off a lackluster year to his standards and Brandon Shell is coming back from an injury-riddled season. Never mind the fact that both remain free agents that are currently unsigned. The only pieces they have are second-year players in Stone Forsythe, who has played little to no snaps, and Jake Curhan who excelled in run-blocking but struggled in pass blocking. This is a high priority in the 2022 NFL Draft, as the Seahawks could use their first selection on a premier tackle within the draft, such as Mississippi state tackle Charles Cross or Alabama tackle Evan Neal.

## **Tier 1 Need**

### LG/RG: The 2022 Seattle Seahawks have 3 serviceable guards. They have Gabe Jackson, an aging but still effective right guard, Damien Lewis, a rising young guard coming off a statistically down year, and Phil Haynes an extraordinarily solid guard who is oft-injured. Jackson, Lewis, and Haynes will be able to manage the fort for the season but Seattle could look to draft a project late with the future in mind.

## **Tier 3 Need**

### C: Center is a position of mediocracy ever since Max Unger left. The Seahawks were unable to resign Ethan Pocic, their former second-round pick, but were able to sign Austin Blythe. Blythe is a perfect scheme fit who comes from the Los Angeles Rams at a time when the current offensive coordinator Shane Waldron and current offensive line coach Andy Dickerson were there. With the signing of Blythe and the resignation of Kyle Fuller, the center is not a need.

## **Tier 4 Need**

# **Overall Seattle Needs Rankings:**
\
## **Tier 1 Need**  — LT/RT

## **Tier 2 Need**  — QB

## **Tier 3 Need** — RB, LG/RG, WR,

## **Tier 4 Need**  — TE, C

## At this current point, the Seahawks roster is far from perfect, with several glaring holes at key positions offensively. Seattle has received some key players such as Drew Lock and Noah Fant in the Russell Wilson trade but also acquired much-needed draft capital that can be used to fix these holes within the roster. With the franchise at a crossroads after the Russell Wilson trade, it will be interesting to see what they will do at the upcoming 2022 NFL Draft.
