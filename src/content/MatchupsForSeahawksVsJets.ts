1. **Seahawks' Run Game vs Jets' Front-7**

   Kenneth Walker has seemed to find his ground once again, posting more than 100 yards against the Kansas City Chiefs. The Chiefs have a weaker interior defensive line, other than Chris Jones, which helped Walker find his OROY campaign once again. But more importantly, Walker improved because he learned to take the short yards and stop bouncing out, which provided the Seahawks an ample running game. Chris Jones is a known for his pass-rushing skills, but the monbster Williams is known for both. The Seahawks interior offensive line has struggled immensly throughout the season, but as the Walker was able to carry the run game by fixing his own mistakes, the Seahawks will face a much stronger front-7. Waldron should scheme Walker to the outside near the defensive backs, an area where he can successfully bounce outside and look for the home run play.

2. **Jets' Run Game vs Seahawks' Front-7**

   The Jets' run game has faltered since impending OROY Breece Hall was met with a frusturating torn ACL. They were expected to reply an armada of Michael Carter and UDFA gem James Robinson but everything has looked completely different. Carter has largely struggled while Robinson has been a healthy inactive after being traded from the Jaguars. The real key member of the Jets' run game is UDFA Zonovan Knight, a rookie who amassed above 250 yards on the ground and 83 through the air. While the numbers may not seem impressive, his production has largely faltered in recent weeks because of poor blocking and strong run defenses. The Seahawks have turned a corner with their run defense after allowing more than 200 yards rushing to a Panthers team without their star Christain McCaffrey. They have allowed around 4 yards per carry to opposing running backs against McCaffrey and the Chiefs' running backs. Expect the Jets to focus on passing through the air, rather than the ground game.

3. **George Fant and Duane Brown vs Uchenna Nwosu, Darrell Taylor, and Boye Mafe**

   George Fant and Duane Brown are both infamous former Seahawks. Fant was best known for coming as the 6th offensive lineman and #74 was a elligible receiver. Duane Brown was known for blocking Wilsons' blindside for the latter half of the decade after sending a second round pick and more to the Texans to get the former first round pick. Uchenna Nwosu has been less efficient in the alst few games, partly due to bettter offensive tackles, but also because he has been overused. Taylor had large expectations and was benched for Irvin after the emergency signing but has recently played more along with Mafe. Boye Mafe is a second round pick who was expected to develop over the course of the season into a well-rounded player, but has largely beat expectations and has been more productive with his limited playtime than Bruce Irvin. Expect the Seahawks' EDGE rotation to feast on an aging Jets' offensive tackle room.

4. **DK Metcalf and Tyler Lockett vs DJ Reed and Sauce Gardner**

   DK Metcalf had a phenomenal game as the clear WR1 with Tyler Lockett out due to an unfortunate hand surgery but is expected to get his partner back against a Jets' defense with an elite cornerback tandem. DJ Reed was a former Seahawks' corner who played near-elite as the CB1 on the Seahawks in the 2021 season but was largely outbid by the Jets on a 3 year 33 million dollar contract that the Seahawks thought to be too expensive. The Jets seemed to have made a smart signing as DJ Reed has continued to perform at a high level with another elite corner across from him in Sauce Gardner, and a better overall pass rush and defensive supporting cast around him. Sauce Gardner is the main competitor to Tariq Woolen's DROY campaign because he has been a true lockdown corner this season. Some may argue that he gets away with Defensive Pass Interference and Holding all too often, but focusing on the matchup Metcalf will most likely line up on Sauce. Expect Sauce to get safety help and double team Metcalf, something Metcalf has dealt with at a near top of the NFL rate. This will be a coin flip matchup depending if Lockett is healthy enough to take the pressure off Metcalf and get open on DJ Reed.
