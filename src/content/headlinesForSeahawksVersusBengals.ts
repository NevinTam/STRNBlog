**Ja'Marr Chase and Tee Higgins vs. Devon Witherspoon and Tariq Woolen**

After a press conference where star WR DK Metcalf stated that "Spoon will get the best of him \[Chase\]," all the pressure is on the rookie to perform. Similarly, Chase in his press conference called the Seahawks star cornerback duo of Tariq Woolen and Devon Witherspoon "not horrible". With tensions extremely high entering a game where Seattle has the chance to cement itself as one of the contenders in the NFC, Seattle knows it has to perform to the best of its ability. Tee Higgins is expected to play after missing their previous dominant win against the Arizona Cardinals. While Witherspoon has the ability to shadow Chase, it is more likely than not that he will stick to his left CB spot because Pete Carroll defenses tend to keep the cornerbacks on one side. Both sides are strongly matched with Chase being one of the best receivers in the league, yet Woolen led the league in INTs last year. Higgins is one of the best wide receiver twos in the league and could be wide receiver one on some teams. But, likewise, Witherspoon has exploded onto the scene after a breakout game against the Giants and was a top-5 draft pick and the first cornerback drafted in the 2023 NFL Draft for a reason.

**Seahawks Pass Rush vs. Bengals Offensive Line**

The Seahawks have had 3 really strong weeks pass rush-wise, including their week 4 game where they recorded 11 sacks, a Monday Night Football record. The Bengals have a decent offensive line that has not been dominant in the run game, explaining why the team will more often than not pass the ball due to their inability to successfully run the ball. With Jamal Adams back for this game, Seattle should be at their highest level of pass-rushing for the season. The Seahawks pass rush should be able to get the better of the Bengals offensive line, but the matchup will be interesting because if Seattle can maintain a high level of a pass rush this game, the NFL will start to consider them one of the best pass rushing units in the entire NFL. Dre'Mont Jones will be a big part of this game because Jarran Reed has shown out these last few games and will most likely get double-teamed more often, so Jones will need to be able to win his 1v1s with individual offensive linemen. Uchenna Nwosu should have a big game against a weak offensive tackle group of the Bengals, as will Boye Mafe and Darrell Taylor. The Seahawks should be able to continue their pass rush performance from the Giants game against the Bengals.

**Seahawks Rushing Attack vs Bengals Rushing Defense**

The Seahawks have sported an impressive rushing attack over 4 weeks in the NFL, having one of the most efficient backfields in the league. This will become critical to beating the Bengals, as they are one of the worst rushing defenses, especially at allowing explosive rushing plays. Look for Waldron and Walker to use more misdirection at times to fool the Bengals, and after they are wore down, for Charbonnet to gash through the defense in the 3rd and 4th to truly hammer in the rushing attack. This dual-attack of thunder and lightning will give the Seahawks an incredible offensive consistency and take pressure off Geno Smith to carry the offense.

**Seahawks Receiving Corps vs Bengals Secondary**

The Seahawks Receiving corps, while on paper may seem overpowering, the Bengals secondary has held up well all season. The Bengals have help opposing WRs back all season, as they are a near top-10 defense against the pass. However, their #1 CB in Chidobe Awuzie was limited in practice and is questionable for the game. Even if he plays, he may not be 100%, allowing for the Seahawks to potentially exploit that. The Seahawks will also look to use their tight end room, which is one of the best in the league at receiving. Coincidentally, the Bengals are one of the worst in the league at defending against tight ends, meaning it may be a big workload for Noah Fant, Colby Parksinson, and Will Dissly.
