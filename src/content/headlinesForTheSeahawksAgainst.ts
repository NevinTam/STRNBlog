**DK Metcalf vs Charvarious Ward**

For all the time Charvarious Ward has been on the 49ers, this matchup has been similar to DK Metcalf and Jalen Ramsey's rivalry. Ward plays extremely physical with DK Metcalf and creates a good matchup every time they face off. For the most part, Ward has gotten the better of DK, despite Metcalf's size. Metcalf had 3 receptions for 32 yards against the 49ers while being shadowed by Ward. Metcalf may be able to get open, but the Seahawks are not able to hold up the pocket long enough for Metcalf to develop his routes. With Abe Lucas back, combined with Charles Cross' emergence, the offensive line may be able to hold up longer for Metcalf's routes to develop.

While the tackles may be able to hold up against the 49ers vaunted EDGE group long enough for Metcalf to get open, the 49ers still have a deep interior defensive line and will be a tough matchup for the Seahawks' interior offensive line. However, the 49ers have ruled out star DT Arik Armstead, so Seattle may have a better chance. Even then, the 49ers may also double-team Metcalf, putting a safety above Ward to limit the potential for Metcalf to break away on a deep throw. Regardless, Metcalf will be the underdog in this matchup until he can take the next step and out-physical Charvarious Ward.

**Charles Cross and Abe Lucas vs Nick Bosa and Chase Young**

The last time these two teams faced each other, Abe Lucas was out. This time Lucas will be back, expected to provide much-needed improvement to a right tackle spot that has been a turnstile since Lucas' injury in week 1. Just 2 weeks ago, Charles Cross held his own against Nick Bosa and Chase Young, not allowing a single sack by either of them when tasked to block them. However, the right side of the offensive line was a struggle to keep Bosa and Young contained, something Lucas will be expected to immediately fix. Jason Peters, Jake Curhan, and Stone Forsythe have started at right tackle this season in place of Lucas, and well, they have been among the league's worst tackles this season.

Lucas played against the Cowboys and the Seahawks were the best on offense they have been this whole season. While Lucas alone may have not caused this explosion on offense, he was a big contributor to it. Lucas should be able to hold his own against Young and Bosa if he is fully healthy, but he may not be. If the Seahawks want to sustain their offensive success from the game against the Cowboys, Lucas may be the key to this piece, despite Geno Smith being active for this game. The Seahawks' offensive success may rest on the performance of backup QB Drew Lock and their struggling interior offensive line.

**Tariq Woolen and Devon Witherspoon vs Deebo Samuel and Brandon Aiyuk**

Tariq Woolen has been better in coverage this year, despite his lack of interceptions that brought prowess to his name last year. Devon Witherspoon has been a standout rookie corner throughout the entire year coming off of his worst game of the year, which was still an average performance. Deebo Samuel is coming off of his best game of the year, putting up 116 receiving yards against the #1 seed team in the NFC who has the most wins in the entire league. Brandon Aiyuk is close to eclipsing 1000 yards on the season and has quietly been one of the 49ers' best star players this year. The last time these two teams played was just 2 weeks ago, and in that game, Aiyuk had only 50 yards, while Samuel had 79. Those are manageable performances considering the team they are facing, but the 49ers did not need to pass to win the game.

The Seahawks beat up on the ground game throughout the entire matchup, allowing Purdy to throw the ball at his will against a team that was focused on trying to stop the run. Seattle may be able to win this matchup, but that will most likely come from the 49ers choosing to run the ball and win that way, rather than Seattle locking down the 49ers' wide receivers. Witherspoon will most likely start at outside left cornerback after Tre Brown is inactive with an injury. This means Witherspoon will be in coverage against Aiyuk and Samuel a lot more than if he was in the slot. While Witherspoon has been a standout in the slot, the Seahawks have not seen too much action with him outside against star WRs.
