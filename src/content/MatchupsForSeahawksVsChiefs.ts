    The Seahawks (7-7) play the Chiefs (11-3) in Arrowhead Stadium this Saturday. Although the Seahawks have been eliminated from winning the division, there is still a chance for them to snatch one of 3 wild card spots in the tight NFC wild card race. Below is 4 matchups for the game.

**1. Seahawks Running Game vs Chiefs Front 7**

The Seahawks rushing offense has fallen off a cliff recently as the performance of the offensive line has declined, leading to a more inconsistent offense during the Seahawks recent losing streak. The Chiefs are about average against the run, giving the Seahawks an opportunity to spark the run game with RBs Kenneth Walker and Deejay Dallas. Walker has slowed down after having a hot streak to start the season, looking as if he was the favorite for the OROY award. However, he has grown as a pass-catcher in recent weeks, as he has done much better at catching the ball in open space, where he excels the most. If the run game does not work, the Seahawks may opt to use the short passing game and screens as a replacement.

**2. Chiefs Defensive Line vs Seahawks Interior Offensive Line**

At the heart of the Seahawks offensive line problems has been the play of the interior offensive line, which has struggled in run blocking and pass blocking, especially last week against the 49ers where Geno Smith was under pressure constantly throughout the game. They will again have a big matchup as they will go against one of the best defensive linemen in the NFL, Chris Jones, who is having a great season on the interior. Jones could easily disrupt the entire Seahawks offensive gameplan and make the offense extremely ineffective.

**3. Seahawks Wide Receivers vs Chiefs CB Core**

The Seahawks losing Tyler Lockett to a broken finger injury makes this matchup crucial as they need to excel against a weak Chiefs secondary, especially if the Seahawk's run game is ineffective. DK Metcalf seems like the player most prime for a big game as he has been playing well even with Lockett taking a large share of targets from him. Now without Lockett, he will be depended on even more by Geno as he is guarded by Chiefs CB1 L'Jarius Sneed, who has given up a 67% completion percentage and over 500 yards in coverage, hopefully allowing Metcalf to excel within a true WR1 role.

**4. Chiefs TE Travis Kelce vs Seahawks LB Jordyn Brooks and SS Teez Tabor**

With the safety Ryan Neal out, the Seahawks are down to their 3rd-string strong safety on the season in Teez Tabor, who has only played limited snaps so far in the season. He and Brooks will be responsible for one of, if not the best, tight end in the league in Travis Kelce, who is having another incredible season with the Chiefs. If the Seahawks defense wishes to have any way to slow down the high-powered offense of the Chiefs, it starts with being able to shut down their number one weapon in Travis Kelce.
