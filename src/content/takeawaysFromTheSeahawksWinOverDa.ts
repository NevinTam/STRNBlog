**Offensive Regroups in 2nd Half to Clutch Win**

The Seahawks had a much better gave offensively compared to last week vs the Ravens (to be honest anything would have been better), with over 480 yards of offense throughout. However, the season-long red-zone issues were again present in the first half, where the Seahawks were able to move the ball but were only able to score 9 points, leading to a tied Seahawks score. Smith was better this week at hitting his receivers, but had a huge mistake where he had an intentional grounding call when trying to avoid a sack. This led to a missed field goal opportunity as time expired in the first half. Smith rebounded quickly from this mistake, having a near flawless second half as he led 2 scoring drives late in the game to clinch the win.

The Seahawks rushing game was a story of two tales. Kenneth Walker got the majority of carries but wasn't able to do much with them. It was a repeated story where he would just get stuck behind tackles or attempt to bounce a run to the outside where the edge was set. Charbonnet had a much more efficient game running through the holes that the OL provided, averaging over 5 YPC. While I think K9 is definetly the better RB right now, it seems that along with giving Charbonnet more snaps (due to his 3rd down capabilities), he is also getting more and more carries as a integral part of the run game.

The Seahawks receiving group had one of their best games in terms of YAC, totalling over 250 YAC from their recievers. JSN has an incredible impact on the screen-game, single-handedly saving it from the depths of designed YAC. His impact is sure to only grow as the season goes, on. Lockett had another clutch set of catches en route to another clutch game with the game leading touchdown. DK Metcalf similarly had another clutch performance, including 2 huge receptions to drive the Seahawks down the field and kick the game-winning field goal.

**Seahawks Defense Holds Up till 4th Quarter**

The Seahawks defense held up for the most part until the floodgates opened 4th quarter. Unfortunately, they gave up 2 huge receptions to RB Brian Robinson in first and third quarters when he was being covered by primarily EDGE players (Dre'Mont Jones and Boye Mafe). However, once the 4th quarter started, they were able to easily march down the field on their final two scoring drives, and score clutch touchdowns to tie up the game. The run defense (which played great for the most part) started to show huge cracks in the 4th quarter, allowing Brian Robinson to march down the field before a huge TD catch by Dynami Brown to tie up the game.

The secondary, overall, limited Howell, but he was able to hit a huge amount of checkdowns en route to over 300 yards of passing offense. Witherspoon had another good game but unfortunately gave up the game-tying touchdown in the final minute. Woolen had probably his best game of the season, locking down WR Terry McLaurin when in coverage and only overall playing lockdown for most of the game.

The pass-rush had a better game as well, as they were able to rack over 15 pressures and got a huge contribution from their EDGE group, which in this game featured moving Dre'Mont Jones with more snaps on the EDGE with Leonard Williams and Jarran Reed playing the IDL roles. This worked beautifully, as each of the 3 recorded 2 pressures apiece. Boye Mafe continued his great streak, now up to 7 sacks in 7 straight games. He has been on a tear lately and could easily become a 14-15 sack guy this season and easily one of the NFL's most premier pass-rushers.
