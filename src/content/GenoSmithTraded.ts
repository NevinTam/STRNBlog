Geno Smith's tenure in Seattle will have ended officially on Wednesday. The Seahawks traded him to the lAs Vegas Raiders in exchange for a 3rd round draft pick (pick #92) in the 2025 NFL Draft. Smith, the Seahawks starter at QB for the last 3 years, had a mixed opinion in the Seahawks community. While he provided stability to the team after the franchise-altering trade of Russell Wilson, he never won a playoff game and missed out on the playoffs twice. Furthermore, in 2024, he threw far too many interceptions that many people in the Seahawks fanbase were okay with. Still, the numbers are undeniable; Smith broke nearly every single season franchise passing record, including yards and completion%. He did all of this while having a bottom 5 offensive line for all 3 years, a bottom 10 defense for 2 of the years, and a turnstile at the running back position. He also had 2 different offensive coordinators in 3 years, and, had he stayed for a 4th year as the starter, he would have had 3 in 4 years. One can only imagine, if the Seahawks had a league-average offensive line, would Smith have been recognized as a top-10 QB across the NFL? That won't be able to be tested out in Seattle though, as Smith reunites with coach that took a chance on him and allowed him to become a starter in the NFL again: Pete Carroll.

Carroll is one of the main contributors for helping Smith turn from a reliable backup to an above-average quarterback. With constant pressure on the Seahawks after the Russell Wilson trade to find their next quarterback, Pete Carroll assured everyone that Geno Smith was a great option, and that he was, leading the Seahawks to a 9-8 record and the playoffs in his first year. He often carried the team on his back, posting unbelievable amounts of game winning drives year-after-year-after-year. He led the league in completion% in 2022 and is recognized as one of the most accurate QBs in the NFL.

Under Carroll, Geno looks to maintain his excellence with a team that is also trying to develop their offensive line. However, Carroll being Smith's coach may help him get back to his 2022 and 2023 QB form given their extremely close relationship. Geno Smith will have a good receiver in Jakobi Myers and an elite tight end in Brock Bowers to throw to. Perhaps, DK Metcalf and Tyler Lockett could end up with Smith throwing them the ball and under Carroll. Albert Breer had a conversation with Geno Smith in the summer of 2023, where he talked with Geno about why he kept signing 1-year deals with Seattle (a total of 4). Essentially, Geno Smith's answer was Pete Carroll, citing his optimism and leadership being able to carry the team through Russell Wilson's injury and give Geno the confidence and spark he needed to perform. It makes sense that once Geno Smith and the Seahawks Front Office were far apart on negotiations, Geno didn't even bother countering, just wanting to get traded, which happened to be with his mentor. It seemed he would have to have taken more to stay with Seattle, but under Carroll he seems like he will take less and be happy that he is re-united with his coach. Money seems to have been the driving force between the split between Smith and the Seahawks, something that is also being shared with Metcalf and John Schneider. Though he re-emerged in Seattle, his heart and passion were with Carroll, and after being around $10 million off of Schneider's initial offer proposal, Smith and his crew chose to save their time with negotiations and just get back with his former coach by requesting a trade. While the trade compensation is an extremely late 3rd round draft pick, the Raiders are taking on all $31 million of Smith's contract, allowing the Seahawks to take that money in hopes of improving their roster and perhaps find their next franchise quarterback.
