The Seahawks (3-3) play the Chargers (4-2) at SoFi Stadium in Los Angeles today. Today will be to see if the Seahawk's defense consistently plays good defense after they shut down Kyler Murray and the Cardinals last week. The Chargers are coming off a dramatic win over the Broncos on MNF but have suffered injuries at key positions, such as Rashawn Slater at LT and Joey Bosa at OLB both on IR for this game. Here are 5 matchups for this week's Seahawks game.

**1. Chargers TE Gerald Everett vs Seahawks SS Ryan Neal, LB Jordyn Brooks, LB Cody Barton**

The Seahawks are in a sort of revenge matchup here, with Everett playing with the Seahawks last season before departing for LA in free agency. Everett so far has gone for 249 yards and 2 touchdowns through 6 games, making him on pace to break his career high in yards, touchdowns, and receptions. On the other hand, the Seahawks have given the 3rd-most yards to tight ends in the entire league, making it critical to stop Everett in the passing game to stop a Chargers team that may be down WR Keenan Allen. Last week the Seahawks were able to stop TE Zach Ertz who had been a large part of the Cardinal's offense with their top WR Deandre Hopkins still suspended, giving hope that the Seahawks can do the same to Everett.

**2.** **Seahawks OTs Charles Cross and Abraham Lucas vs Chargers OLB Khalil Mack**

The Seahawk's rookie tackle duo has played great to start the season, exceeding the expectations of many. However, this previous game might have been their worst showing of the season, each giving up several pressures in an overall poor showing by the offensive line. In this game, the protection will have to be good for Geno Smith to play at the elite level he was at in the first 5 weeks. We saw what Mack could do on Monday against the Broncos, consistently causing pressure on QB Russell Wilson. Mack currently has 6 sacks (tied for second in the league) and can easily make a life for Geno extremely difficult within the pocket, making it even more critical the rookie tackles hold up against one of the best in the game.

**3.** **Seahawks WRs DK Metcalf and Tyler Lockett vs Chargers CBs JC Jackson and Asante Samuel Jr**

The Seahawks receiver duo was quiet last week against the Cardinals, recording a combined 51 yards off 5 receptions. If Geno has more time within the pocket, it will be important this duo can return to the form they have shown through the first 5 weeks. Jackson got benched for his poor play in the Broncos game where he gave up 86 yards on 2 receptions and had a pass-interference penalty, but is still slated to start against the Seahawks as the Chargers attempt to put him in better positions to make plays. This will be a prime opportunity for Metcalf and Lockett to get open against a struggling corner like Jackson. Opposite of him, Samuel has played decently, yielding a 57/1% completion percentage and 264 yards through 4 games, but already having allowed 2 touchdowns in coverage. On the Seahawks side of the ball, Tyler Lockett is nursing a hamstring injury today, meaning he may not be at 100% since he was out of practice throughout the week. We might see more from Metcalf today since the hamstring injury held Lockett out of practice all week, making this matchup even more critical for the success of the offense.

**4. Chargers RB Austin Ekeler and Chargers OL vs Seahawks DL and Seahawks LBs Jordyn Brooks and Cody Barton**

The Seahawk's run-stopping unit excelled against the Cardinals last week, limiting Cardinals RB Eno Benjamin to only 2.5 YPC. They'll need a similar type of performance today going against RB Austin Ekeler, who has averaged 4.7 YPC and more recently has averaged 130 scrimmage yards and two touchdowns in the last 3 games, making him an incredible dual-threat running back. The Seahawks have struggled with receiving backs in the past, most recently with Alvin Kamara of the Saints, who had over 100 yards receiving and over 90 yards receiving in week 5. It will be important that Brooks and Barton are able to stop Ekeler before he gets going as a pass-catcher, allowing the Chargers to get chunk plays and move the chains at will.

**5. Chargers OTs Jamaree Salyer and Trey Pipkins III vs Seahawks OLBs Uchenna Nwosu and Boye Mafe/Darrell Taylor**

The Chargers are without star LT Rashawn Slater, who played extremely well as a rookie but is now on injured reserve due to a torn bicep. Replacing him is OT Jamaree Salyer, who along with Trey Pipkins gave up several pressures against the Broncos on MNF. For the Seahawks, this game is a revenge game for Nwosu, who previously played with the Chargers for 4 seasons and has had a good start to the season, where he's on pace to break his career record for sacks. It will be important to keep pressure on Herbert like the Broncos were able to do with OLBs Bradley Chubb and Randy Gregory. A sign of pass-rushing life came from Nwosu and Taylor last week, who each recorded a sack and had a combined 5 pressures on Kyler Murray, the effect of which was obvious. A similar performance today would go a long way in securing a Seahawks win.
