1. Middle Linebackers, specifically Jordyn Brooks...

After releasing Bobby Wagner the Seahawks organization placed immense trust in Jordyn Brooks, a 2020 first-round pick. With a switch to a 3-4 defense, middle linebackers Jordyn Brooks and Cody Barton will remain on the field at the same time as the off-ball linebackers. Jordyn Brooks had all the hype entering the season with a 183 tackle season with ending the season with 20 tackles against the Arizona Cardinals. So far this season Barton and Brooks seem lost, covering no one or covering the wrong person, leaving a wide-open player on complete blown coverages. If the Seahawks want to stop bending Brooks and Barton need to step up their game and create chemistry with the big fellas in front of them.

2. Lack of pressure from Taylor and the defensive line

Darrell Taylor was raved about by almost every Seahawk's coach entering the season, but boy they were very wrong. Coming off a season with 6.5 sacks and 4 of them coming in his first 5 games, Taylor was expected to reach double digits sacks with ease. While hindsight is 20-20 we may have been able to understand Taylor's projections were too lofty because in 11 games he posted 2.5 sacks and went 4 games without posting any sacks and only a combined 5 pressures in that time. The defensive line also has been unable to record meaningful amounts of pressure, except for Al Woods who seems to age like fine wine as a 35-year-old defensive tackle. Poona Ford, mainly known for his run defense, was expected to be a contributor in the pass rushing aspect but has not reported a single pressure in either of Seattle's first two 2022 games. In the other defensive end position, there is a rotation between Shelby Harris and Quinton Jefferson. Shelby Harris has only recorded 2 pressures that none of which came against the 49ers. Quinton Jefferson has also posted the same stat line with 2 pressures and likewise, both his pressures came against the Denver Broncos. The Seahawks knew they wouldn't have a defensive line group with any significant pass rushing ability, but with the emergence of Myles Adams in the preseason as a fierce pass rusher, we can expect the entire pass rush group to emerge once Adams plays his first 2022 NFL snaps.

3. Running Game (??)

After trading Russell Wilson for a boatload of assets most everyone knew the Seahawks would not have any good options for the quarterback position entering the 2022 season. While they could have gotten a better option than the combination of Drew Lock and Geno Smith, they chose not to, cementing their hope in the run game. Entering Week 3 the run game has been a huge disappointment as Rashaad Penny and Kenneth Walker III, their two starters, have gotten 85 yards in a combined 2 games. This may not be a problem if the passing game was flourishing unimaginably and there was no need to run the ball consistently, but this is all but the case. With their limited running in the last 6 quarters, Seattle's offense has put up a whopping 0 points. They have chosen to omit their run game because they believe their passing game is working but very evidently shown this is not reality. If Seattle wants to set up their passing game or even start using their running game they need to run more efficiently to create more opportunities. Entering the third week the passing game fell out after the first half of the Broncos game and the run game never got working. If the Seahawks want an offense they need to start running the ball which in return, will help the passing game and the offense put up points.
