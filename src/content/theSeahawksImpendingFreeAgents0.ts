The unofficial Free Agency period opens on March 13th, 9 a.m. PST and lasts until March 15th, 12:59 p.m. This is where many free agents will sign, but can still back out of a deal because offers only go official past 12:59 on March 15th, during the official free agency opening. The Seahawks will look to add some key pieces in free agency to build off their Wildcard Berth, but before that will need to look and their impending offensive free agents and see if they should be brought back or allowed to test free agency. This article will talk about every Seattle offensive free agent who is yet to be extended (Phil Haynes and Nick Bellore were extended before the publishing of this article), the contract they will most likely receive, and if the Seahawks should resign them or let them test free agency and be open for other teams to attempt to sign them.

**RB Rashaad Penny**

After being the starter for the first 5 games of the 2022 season, Rashaad Penny exited the field against the Saints with a gruesome leg injury that would keep him sidelined for the remainder of the season. Penny was elite during this duration, posting 6.1 yards per carry and 346 rushing yards in 4.5 games. As the season progresses high yards per carry tend to decrease, but even through 1/3 of the season Penny still remained elite. Rashaad Penny has always had the talent to be an elite running back and has sporadically showcased it early throughout his career, and even was consistently elite during the 2022 season. The biggest issue for Rashaad Penny has always been health but signing him to a cheap deal with the chance to have a star-studded running back for the whole season or at least a small portion of it is too hard for the Seahawks to pass up.

**Expected Free Agency Offer:** 1 year contract worth 3.8 million

Sh**ould the Seahawks resign:**Yes, Penny has the potential to be elite, and splitting the backfield with Kenneth Walker should grow his longevity.

**C Austin Blythe**

When former second-round pick Ethan Pocic left to sign with the Cleveland Browns the Seattle Seahawks needed an immediate replacement at center. Austin Blythe, the former Rams center who played under Shane Waldron and Andy Dickerson and sat as a backup behind Creed Humphrey emerged as the clear frontrunner. Blythe has large familiarity with the Seahawks' current offensive line and offensive coordinator coach and is comfortable with the terminology and functions of the new scheme. At the start of the year Blythe seemed to be able to hold his own in both pass-protection and run-blocking, but as the season progressed his smaller frame became largely exploited in the run game, causing a weak Seahawks run game for the middle parts of the season. By the end of the season, Blythe was a weakness, rather than a strength on an offensive line that needed to get younger for the future. Blythe may return as a backup, but otherwise, if the Seahawks continue their youth trend, Blythe will not be a starter on the Seattle Seahawks.

**Expected Free Agency Offer:** 1 year contract totaled 1.8 million

Sh**ould the Seahawks resign:**Yes, Blythe should be brought back as a backup purely, and be willing to help a rookie center similarly become accustomed to the scheme.

**QB Geno Smith**

Geno Smith was a top-5 quarterback in the 2022 NFL season. In all the years prior, Geno Smith was never even close to being an average quarterback. This led to Geno being delegated as a career backup until this season. Geno Smith may be one of the most interesting contract situations to watch across the entire NFL. Any team offering Geno Smith shouldn't give too much because of his short success, but also needs to respect the talent he portrayed this season. Geno could get anywhere from 30 to 40 million on average per year of his contract. I expect him to get a 2 or 3 year deal to make sure that if this is the last payout of his NFL career, he makes as much money as possible. Smith earns every penny of his contract and has a strong case to make 35 million dollars per year.

**Expected Free Agency Offer:** 3 year contract totaled 98 million

Sh**ould the Seahawks resign:**Yes, Smith showcased top-5 franchise quarterback attributes throughout the season and the Seahawks would make a mistake letting a freshly discovered franchise gem at quarterback reach the open free-agent market.

**QB Drew Lock**

Recent Broncos quarterback Drew Lock is one of the best backup quarterbacks in the league. Lock, a borderline starter, has shown the potential to be a full-time starter in this league. Having Lock as a backup would put the Seahawks at ease if Geno Smith was ever not able to play. The Seahawks traded for Drew Lock in the Russell Wilson trade for a reason, and it would be a shame to never utilize him on the field. Another team may sign Drew Lock to a starting job if he reaches the open market, but Seattle will attempt to sign him for enough money before free agency opens to keep him in Seattle. Also, if Geno Smith does not resign Drew Lock may be the #1 option for the Seahawks moving forward unless they decide to invest in a signal caller in the draft.

**Expected Free Agency Offer:** 1 year contract totaled 3.5 million

Sh**ould the Seahawks resign:**Yes, Lock is one of the best backups any team in the National Football League could ask for.

**WR Marquise Goodwin**

Marquise Goodwin was statistically one of the best wide receivers in getting open in the entire NFL in 2022. In only playing in 12 games due to injury he amassed 387 yards. If he played the entire season he would have gotten 548 yards, a number that would have ranked near the top of the leaderboard in terms of productive 3rd wide receivers. Goodwin still would have culminated to fewer yards on the season than he should have based if we value his open rate because the Seahawks' offense was built on spreading the ball around, meaning there were 3 good tight ends also eating into the volume of Goodwin. Marquise Goodwin is a speedy wide receiver that matches very well with Lockett and Metcalf and should be resigned to take care of a common need the Seahawks have had in the past. However, the Seahawks resigning Goodwin should not hamper the team's ability to go draft a 3rd wide receiver in the draft, allow one of their younger receivers to earn more opportunities and playing time, and go trade for a qualified veteran.

**Expected Free Agency Offer:** 1 year contract totaled 4.1 million

Sh**ould the Seahawks resign:**Yes, Goodwin should be brought back as the starter for the 3rd wide receiver position, but the Seahawks should not be afraid of adding in extra competition.

**C/G Kyle Fuller**

Kyle Fuller has served as a backup for the Seahawks at center for most of the recent seasons. 2 years ago, Fuller, won the starting job over Ethan Pocic, but within a few weeks played so terribly that Ethan Pocic won the job back with ease. Last year, he played as a backup behind Blythe and played admirably for a few snaps. Still, it was not enough to usurp Blythe for starting spot. The Seahawks need to understand that having Blythe or Fuller start at center for their offense in 2023 will provide no change from their struggles in 2022. If the Seahawks go bring in a quality center or draft a rookie, expect Blythe to help the rookie adjust to the scheme. If Blythe and a rookie make the roster there should be no reason to bring back Kyle Fuller to the team.

**Expected Free Agency Offer:** 1 year contract worth 1.1 million

Sh**ould the Seahawks resign:**No, Fuller will have no spot on the team is Blythe is resigned as a backup.

**FB Cullen Gillaspia**

Cullen only played snaps on defense in 6 games during the entire season. He had a combined 4 tackles across the full season. If the Seahawks ever resign him he will continue to be a special teamer with the hopes of making the roster. The Seahawks shouldn't worry about Cullen leaving in free agency because he will not be a hot commodity. If the Seahawks need special teamers expect Cullen to return to the Pacific Northwest.

**Expected Free Agency Offer:** 1 year contract totaled 1.1 million

Sh**ould the Seahawks resign:**Yes, Cullen should not be an immediate priority and should be signed during the later days of free agency if the Seahawks need special team help.

**WR Penny Hart**

Penny Hart somehow manages his way back to the Seattle roster every single year as a coveted practice squad/bench player. Penny has shown little to be impressed about during his tenure with the Seahawks and should not be signed back to the team to allow other younger receivers with more to earn to fight for a roster spot. Regardless, Hart will more likely than not be resigned to play a couple of snaps every season.

**Expected Free Agency Offer:** 1 year contract totaled 1.0 million

Sh**ould the Seahawks resign:**No, Hart should not be resigned to make way for other young receivers, but will somehow still get resigned as a backup with little upside.

**RB Travis Homer**

Travis Homer has been a good backup running back that has improved vastly over the last few seasons. He has played well in the limited playing time he has earned. Homer is the team's best 3rd down running back and is able to pass block and catch the ball well out of the backfield. With no other Seattle running back able to fill the role of Homer, Travis should be signed back to the team fairly quickly in the opening hours of free agency. Still, Homer should not prevent the Seahawks from getting a 3-down back that can be a competitive running back to Homer's 3rd-down duties.

**Expected Free Agency Offer:** 1 year contract totaled 3.1 million

Sh**ould the Seahawks resign:**Yes, Homer is a good running back that can be of use on some runs every game and is the team's best 3rd down running back. Resigning Homer should not make the team afraid to go after another running back to compete with Homer's 3rd-down role.
