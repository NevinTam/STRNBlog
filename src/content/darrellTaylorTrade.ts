## Taylor's Background: 

Taylor has posted 21.5 sacks in his tenure with the Seahawks. In just 3 years, those are quite good numbers. After missing his rookie season due to a leg injury, Taylor burst onto the scene with 6.5 sacks. The next year, playing less snaps he put up 9.5 sacks. Year 3, being placed in a reserve role but needing to play with ***Uchenna Nwosu's*** injury, Taylor put up 5.5 sacks. He put up 58 pressures, which is quite elite for someone who only sees the field ~40% of all snaps. So why trade him, and why trade him for a 6th round pick? 

Taylor has never been able to stop the run. The Seahawks have tried every year to play him on early downs to keep one of their best pass rushers on the field, but are forced to take him off when he cannot uphold the integrity of his run defense lane. This has led him to becoming a full-time 3rd down pass rusher where offensive run plays are few. Even with the limited opportunities on 3rd down, Taylor has still been quite effective as a rusher. 

Taylor had been improving at defending the run this preseason but it may have not been enough for the team to keep him around. The Bears receive one of the better pure pass rushers in the league, but in most cases, only that.

## Seahawks's Roster:

Taylor was the EDGE3 last year, but with an injury became EDGE2. This year, he had been reverted to EDGE4 or EDGE5, behind Nwosu, ***Boye Mafe***, and ***Derick Hall*** in both cases and behind defeinsive line hybrid ***Dre'Mont Jones*** in the latter. ***Mike Morris*** has also played on the EDGE quite a bit this preseason, so it leaves Taylor, the player who can only be played in select moments, as the odd man on the roster. ***Jamie Sheriff*** has also been standing out this preseason who could solidify the Seahawks practice squad EDGE spot this season, with perhaps ***Nelson Ceaser*** joining him. 

The Seahawks have a plethora of EDGE replacements, but no pure or proven EDGE outside of Mafe and Nwosu. Fans may assume the team has seen enough from their other EDGE options to feel comfortable trading Taylor for a small draft pick. With Hall also emerging, Taylor may have rarely seen the field, which would not have been worth it to pay the ~$3 million cap hit to him. The Seahawks clear roughly $2 million in cap space, leaving them around $10 mil. 

Leaving around $3.5 million for the team's practice squad and another ~$3 million for in-season roster moves, the team has around $3.5 million to make a move, perhaps among the defensive line. Safety could also be an issue with ***Rayshawn Jenkins*** coming down with an injury recently. Regardless, Schneider does have the space to make a move if needed, but might also just comfortably sit with the extra space and not use it.
