Jalen Carter is the undisputable best player in this draft. He has been ranked as the #1 prospect by many in this draft. Carter was a beast on a very talented Georgia defense that has produced multiple high-draft picks in recent years. Purely as a player, Carter is rated at, or higher than, Will Anderson Jr, the other elite defender in this draft. Jalen Carter has just turned 22 years old and has all the potential to keep growing as a menace at the 3T position.

His off-field issues and his conditioning at his Pro Day are the reasons he might fall. He showed up to his Pro Day close to 10lbs heavier and had repeatedly cramped during the event and was exhausted due to a lack of conditioning. He may fall for those reasons in the draft, but rather than us speculating about Carter's character, let's try to decipher what a GM said and if Carter fits the description.

John Schneider recently appeared on Seattle Sports for his weekly Thursday appearance to catch up with the fan base with all things Seahawks. Let's see what he said that could be Jalen Carter.

He said at the 8 min mark he was on a secret private workout that he can't disclose, but "we had an interview today trying to figure out the truth of it, this guy did a great job today" there's one major player that teams need to figure out if he can fit in a professional setting.

That's very obviously Jalen Carter. He also said "Having those players spend more time with the team psychologist (before the draft) is incredibly important," Schneider said.

"When alarms go off, you have to work with the team psychologist and try to find out what their mental makeup is. You want to determine if you can help the player or if he will be a detriment to the team," Schneider said.

Alarms went off for Jalen Carter and the Seahawks tried to decipher him, and he seemed to be a good person. They sent their team psychologist who helps interview draft prospects as well, and he seemed to be impressed with how Carter acted.

He needed to find the truth out about a guy and with the help of the team's psychologist realized Carter isn't what the media has shaped him up to be. In other words, Jalen Carter is a Seahawk on April 27th, 2023.

There have been certain reports also explaining Carter's good behavior, such as buying lunch for one of his teammates every day after learning the teammate did not have funds to buy his own meals. The negative comments about Carter have only emerged in recent months, the time right before the draft when prospects are under the most stress they will ever face in their life, knowing April may define the rest of their lives.

In now what will be an official visit, the Seattle Seahawks are reportedly using one of their top 30 visits on Jalen Carter who will meet with the team on Thursday. The unofficial private visit was what appeared to be where the Seahawks flew a plane and visited Carter and his family in their hometown, but this top 30 visit will be where Carter gets flown to the team's facility. They will use this visit as an official way to better understand Jalen using a second meeting.

From what we can see, Carter surpassed all expectations in their unofficial visit, and if he continues to beat expectations again on Thursday, expect Seattle to not waiver on draft day and pick him immediately.

**How would Carter fit with the Seahawks?**

As of now, Dre'Mont Jones and Jarran Reed would be the starters for the Seahawks. While this wouldn't be the worst duo, Jarran Reed's talents are best maximized when not starting as Reed had started close to 40 snaps per game the last 2 years and his production fell off a cliff. With Carter starting alongside Jones, Reed could play 15-25 snaps a game and be well-rested and provide a pass rush boost whenever needed.   

Carter would be a 3-down player that alongside Jones would provide the pass rush the Seahawks have lacked from the defensive line for the past few years. John Schneider has stressed that the defensive line has needed to be fully revamped so expect Seattle to draft Carter even after giving Jones a hefty contract. Carter would be strong in the run game, disrupting plays to allow players like Uchenna Nwosu and Darrell Taylor to get in the backfield. He would also be able to use his unique combination of speed and power to beat NFL guards and get to the quarterback.

The Seahawks had one of the better secondaries in the NFL, even with their lackluster pass rush, meaning adding Carter could amount in even better seasons from their talent pieces in the secondary. Also, if the Seahawks can use Carter and others to have a consistent pass rush, this would allow Jamal Adams to go on undetected blitzes more often as he wouldn't be doubled team due to opposing offenses needing to double team players such as Uchenna Nwosu, Jalen Carter, and Dre'Mont Jones. Jalen Carter can provide the much-needed pass rush the Seahawks need to return their defense to their former glory.
