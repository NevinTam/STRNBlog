        The Seahawks finished a season sweep of their division rivals, the Arizona Cardinals. The Seahawks defense kept up the resurgence they had that started in the first game against the Arizona Cardinals, and the offense managed several clutch drives late in the game that sealed it away. Here are some highlights from the game:

**Geno Smith**

This was not Geno's best game by a long shot. In the same way that Smith could have had 5 touchdowns last week, he could have had 2 more interceptions this week that were dropped. The reason Geno Smith is here, however, is that after he threw a pick-six, he could lead 3 straight back-breaking drives against the Cardinals defense, putting the game out of reach. On these drives, the Seahawks went 7/7 with Smith delivering several clutch conversions in 3rd-long scenarios. Smith showed more of his game-winning ability that he showed off last-week against the Giants, this time on a more consistent basis to fully put the Cardinals away and help give the Seahawks their 4-straight win by double digits. Like in past games, Smith heavily utilized Tight Ends in the passing game, as almost half of Smith's passing yardage was via tight end completions. Overall Smith played a good game and was able to come back from adversity to close out an important divisional game.

**Tight Ends**

Speaking of tight ends, as stated before, they were instrumental in keeping the rhythm and consistency of the offense up. Tight ends were used heavily to get key 3rd-down conversions to keep drives alive and they also had several big plays in the passing games. This included a trick play that ended with a big play pass from Geno Smith to Noah Fant in a tight window, as well as a 51-yard YAC completion to Fant to close out the game. Tight Ends have been critical to the offense all year, keeping the offensive consistency up as Smith's second option in the passing game. They will likely still be important as many of the teams they play in the 2nd half of the year have average or above average offenses, meaning that keeping a consistency through short completions to the tight ends rather than the run game will be critical.

**Offensive Line**

The offensive line for the Seahawks played excellent pass-blocking wise, only giving up 2 sacks to the Cardinals, both in a 3rd-quarter 3 and out. Outside of that, they were able to limit the Cardinals pass rush in a way they were not able to do in the first meeting against them. In the run-blocking department they were more inconsistent, but were able to get going in the 4th quarter to support 2 Ken Walker touchdowns that effectively put the game away. One player that really excelled this game was guard Damien Lewis, who might have had one of, if not the best, game of his career against the Cardinals. Going against Cardinals defensive linemen JJ Watt and Zach Allen, Lewis played great in pass-blocking situations and delivered key blocks in several Walker runs, including his 2nd touchdown which essentially ended the game.

**Improved Linebacker Play**

The main inside linebackers for the Seahawks, Jordyn Brooks, and Cody Barton, have overall played much better during the Seahawk's defensive resurgence. Barton, in particular, seems to have the biggest bounce-back, as he was at times playing awfully in run defense near the beginning of the season. Barton has played better in a reduced role, as the Seahawks have shifted to using more dime looks that have Barton off the field. Brooks has also played well in the past few weeks but in this recent Cardinals game had a mental error that allowed Deandre Hopkins to get wide-open on a touchdown. Outside of those issues, he has played well in coverage after a shaky start to the season. The Seahawks outside linebackers have also played well this game, as Uchenna Nwosu had another 2-sack game to bring his total count to 7 on the year. Bruce Irvin also had a sack while playing for the injured Darrell Taylor. Boye Mafe didn't see the field as much as either but recorded a tackle and a pressure. The resurgence of the pass-rush from the edge has been key in limiting opposing offenses during this 4-week stretch.

**Cornerbacks Locks Down Opposing Receivers**

Many knew that this game would be a big test for the Seahawk's young CB core, going against Deandre Hopkins (previously suspended), new acquisition Robbie Anderson, and the shifty Rondale Moore. The Seahawks were able to shut down the Cardinals vertical passing attack, instead forcing the Cardinals to play more horizontally on passes close to the line of scrimmage. This quality play by the Seahawks led to them only giving up 101 yards of total offense to the Cardinals WR's, many of which were short passes. Specifically in the secondary, Tariq Woolen had another great game locking down Deandre Hopkins when in coverage while also playing good in run defense, including an early stop on a James Conner screen from the Cardinals. Michael Jackson got targeted quite a bit against the Cardinals, but only gave up 15 yards in total. Coby Bryant had a fumble and interception taken away by penalties, but did not play good, allowing 9 completions for 91 yards. Seahawks will need too have another strong showing by the secondary as they take on the Buccaneers, a team whose offense is based off the passing attack and has struggled throughout this season.

The Seahawks played another great game against a Cardinals team that was desperately trying to claw back into the playoff race in a weak NFC. They proved that the defense was legitimately a top 10 quality unit and that the offense had the ability to put games away, a key trait that the Seahawks did not have last year. With the Seahawks in play for the divisional title, they must be able to secure wins against teams like the Buccaneers, who have looked like a shell of their former selves. Check back next week to see our takeaways from the Buccaneers game in Munich!
