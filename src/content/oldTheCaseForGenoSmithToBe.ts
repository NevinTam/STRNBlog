    The Seahawks have many directions they can go this offseason after trading franchise QB Russell Wilson. This series will explore several of these directions and explain their benefits and drawbacks. The first QB we'll be taking a look at was Wilson's backup for 3 years, QB Geno Smith.

**Familiarity with Offense**

Smith has been within the Seattle offense for the past 3 years, and knows much of the offensive playbook and personnel that would help him compete for the starting QB job. Even with the switch to a more WC offense with the arrival of Shane Waldron, Smith proved he was able to execute the gameplan effectively. In 4 games played, Smith totaled 702 yards, 5 touchdowns, 69% completion percentage, and only 1 interception. These stats could easily increase after another year under Waldron's offense with better talent surrounding him.

**Connection with DK Metcalf**

While playing with Geno, Seattle's star WR DK Metcalf seemed much more involved within the offense. In 4 games with Smith, Metcalf had 295 yards and 5 touchdowns. 2 of these games with Smith were some of Metcalf's highest on the entire season. With a full season starting, there's no reason Metcalf couldn't have continued success with Smith seeing what they've done together in only a 4 game sample size.

**Cons**

**Lack of Upside**

Geno Smith is a 31-year-old QB who will turn 32 in October and has minimal starting experience, especially more recently in his career. He has had 2 real starting seasons in the NFL, both being his first 2 years. From 2016 to 2021 (\*did not log any passing yards in 2019) he has thrown a whopping 1346 yards. For reference in his first 2 seasons combined, he threw for over 4 times that amount alone. Other QBs are much younger with a higher draft pedigree and more upside waiting to be called. Geno Smith at 31, will most likely not reveal any new potential making him an older option who could regress soon and is extremely limited in his upside. If Seattle wants to find its quarterback of the present and the future Geno may not provide that option due to his high age (which could lead to regression sooner than later) and his lack of starting regularly every Sunday.

**Lack of Clutch Factor**

In the few games he played in, with the unprecedented injury of Russell Wilson, Geno Smith was unable to "reach gold". During his playing time against the Rams, which wasn't a start, he drove down the field excellently and scored but in the next drive soon after threw far ahead of a fallen Tyler Lockett which ended up in a Los Angeles Ram's hands. Similarly, against the Steelers, the Seahawks were late in overtime and the game had called for Geno, but on a prolonged play Geno fumbled and the ball yet again, ended up in the opposition's clutches. If he were to become the starter expect the opposite of Russell Wilson early in his career, in terms of the clutch factor late in games.

While there are many reasons why we should, and shouldn't start Geno Smith let us know if you think he is a starter who can be of quality service for us.

Overall, Geno Smith has the potential to be a good bridge QB that can effectively manage and execute Shane Waldron's offense. The 2nd year with starter reps will only lead to further opportunities for Smith, but it remains to be seen if his flaws allow another to take the starting QB battle. The next few months during training/minicamp will be key to understanding who is the best QB for the Seahawks right now.
