**Offense Does Just Enough**
The offense again this week appeared as if it was shooting itself in the foot with poor blocking in both pass and run games. This hampered the Seahawks passing offense that started off slow. It was until big gains to Kenneth Walker and a screen to JSN that opened up the offense for their first (and only touchdown) of the game, capped off by a short JSN TD to take the lead going into the second half. Following halftime, it was more of the same, as Geno was sacked and they punted back to the Cardinals. In the 4th quarter, they were able to finally muster up a lengthy drive, until it was ended by an untimely Geno Smith interception. From here, the offense ha one more shaky drive that eventually ended in a long field goal, but it was ultimately an un-inspiring effort despite great attempts by players like K9 (broke 16 tackles!) and JSN.

**Defense Brings down the Curtain**
The Seahawks immediately began the game with back-to-back sacks on the Cardinals opening drive. They were able to repeatedly rush Kyler Murray and put pressure on him. Even with his elusiveness, he wasnâ€™t able to make many plays on the run. The Seahawks rush defense, something that had been one of the worst in the league during the past couple of months, has tightened up, allowing under 50 yards rushing against a stout Arizona rushing attack. The defense also was able to generate key points on their own, including a 69-yard pick six by safety Cob Bryant. Outside of a couple chunk completions, the Cardinals offense was completely stomped out, as they faced heavy pressure and were forced to become one dimensional for much of the game. DL Leonard Williams had maybe his best game as a Seahawk, recording 2.5 sacks and numerous pressures that completely disrupted the game. The Seahawks now move into first in the NFC West and control their own destiny as the NFC playoff picture comes together. Their next game is out East vs the struggling New York Jets, who are coming off a bye.
