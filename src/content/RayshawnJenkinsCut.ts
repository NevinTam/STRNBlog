After signing with the Seahawks last offseason, former Seahawks starting safety Rayshawn Jenkins has been cut after just 1 year with the team. While he played decently as the starter before his injury that placed him on injured reserve, he struggled mightily after his return, missing tackles while being delegated to the 3rd safety spot due to the emergence of Coby Bryant as a starting safety. Jenkins signed a 2-year, $12 million contract with $6.26 million guaranteed. This release saves the Seahawks approximately $5.3 million against the cap. Jenkins will look to secure a role on a team where he can provide experience or depth, or may even attempt to be a starter. This move leaves the Seahawks without a safety 3, a role they have been trying to fill and then run on defense since the Pete Carroll days.

With Mike Macdonald getting career years out of Julian Love and Coby Bryant, if he could get another young safety into the room, could he help them become a valuable contributor at the safety position for the Seahawks? Moreover, getting a veteran safety who perhaps still has a few years of his prime left could fill the spot for this year. A veteran safety would also provide a veteran presence in the room, albeit Julian Love seems to have emerged as the veteran in the secondary. The $5.3 million saved with this move could be used to find Jenkins' replacement for the 2025 NFL regular season, but the offensive line still has major weaknesses and $5.3 million could be the difference between the good and great linemen in free agency. While the Seahawks still will need a 3rd safety, Jerrick Reed could step up in that role or the Seahawks could take a chance on someone in the draft to compete for that spot. Regardless, this offseason will be pivotal for a team trying to make the postseason after missing out 2 years in a row.
